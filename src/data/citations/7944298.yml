  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant disorder of the peripheral nerves leading to increased
  susceptibility to mechanical traction or compression. Some patients have been
  shown to be carriers of a 1.5-Mb deletion in chromosome 17p11.2, which
  corresponds to the duplicated region present in most patients with
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A. Recently, evidence has been presented
  that the deletion is not the only cause of HNPP. To determine the prevalence
  of the 1.5-Mb deletion, we have examined 22 unrelated families with HNPP in
  the following two ways by polymerase chain reaction analysis of marker loci
  D17S122 and D17S261, and by gene dosage measurements with DNA probes for
  D17S122 (VAW409R3a) and D17S125 (VAW412R3a) and for the PMP-22 gene. The
  efficiency and sensitivity of these methods is discussed. Our results show
  that the prevalence of the 17p deletion in our families with HNPP is 68%. One
  patient, presenting as a sporadic case, was found to be affected by a de novo
  deletion in the paternal chromosome. Single-strand conformation analysis of
  the protein-coding region of the PMP-22 gene did not reveal any mutation in
  patients from the 7 families lacking the 17p deletion. As a group, these
  families could not be distinguished by clinical, electrophysiological, or
  morphological features from the families with the deletion.
