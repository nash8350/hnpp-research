  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) was initially described more than 100 years
  ago by Charcot, Marie, and Tooth. It was only recently, however, that
  molecular genetic studies of CMT have uncovered the underlying causes of most
  forms of the diseases. Most cases of CMT1 are associated with a 1.5-Mb tandem
  duplication in 17p11.2-p12 that encompasses the PMP22 gene. Although many
  genes may exist in this large duplicated region, PMP22 appears to be the major
  dosage-sensitive gene. CMT1A is the first autosomal dominant disease
  associated with a gene dosage effect due to an inherited DNA rearrangement.
  There is no mutant gene, but instead the disease phenotype results from having
  3 copies of a normal gene. Furthermore, these findings suggest that
  therapeutic intervention in CMT1A duplication patients may be possible by
  normalizing the amount of PMP22 mRNA levels. Alternatively, CMT1A can be
  caused by mutations in the PMP22 gene. Other forms of CMT are associated with
  mutations in the MPZ (CMT1B) and Cx32 (CMTX) genes. Thus, mutations in
  different genes can cause similar CMT phenotypes. The related but more severe
  neuropathy, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS), can also be caused by mutations in
  the PMP22 and MPZ genes. All 3 genes thus far identified by CMT researchers
  appear to play an important role in the myelin formation or maintenance of
  peripheral nerves. CMT1A, CMT1B, CMTX, hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP), and DSS have been called myelin disorders or
  "myelino-pathies." Other demyelinating forms, CMT1C and CMT-AR, may be caused
  by mutations of not yet identified myelin genes expressed in Schwann cells.
  The clinically distinct disease HNPP is caused by a 1.5-Mb deletion in
  17p11.2-p12, which spans the same region duplicated in most CMT1A patients.
  Underexpression of the PMP22 gene causes HNPP just as overexpression of PMP22
  causes CMT1A. Thus, 2 different phenotypes can be caused by dosage variations
  of the same gene. It is apparent that the CMT1A duplication and HNPP deletion
  are the reciprocal products of a recombination event during meiosis mediated
  through the CMT1A-REPs. CMT1A and HNPP could be thought of as a "genomic
  disease" more than single gene disorders. Other genetic disorders may also
  prove to arise from recombination events mediated by specific chromosomal
  structural features of the human genome (102). Further studies on the
  recombination mechanism of CMT and HNPP might reveal the causes of site
  specific homologous recombination in the human genome. The discovery of the
  PMP22 gene in the 1.5-Mb CMT1A duplication/HNPP deletion critical region also
  suggests that the clinical phenotype of chromosome aneuploid syndromes may
  result from the effect of a small subset of dosage-sensitive genes mapping
  within the region of aneuploidy. The understanding of the molecular basis of
  CMT1 and related disorders has allowed accurate DNA diagnosis and genetic
  counseling of inherited peripheral neuropathies and will make it possible to
  develop rational strategies for therapy. As several loci for CMT2 have been
  identified, the genes responsible for CMT2 will most likely be disclosed using
  positional cloning and candidate gene approaches in the near future.
