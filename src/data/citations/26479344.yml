  Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) is the most common type of hereditary
  motor and sensory neuropathies (HMSN), caused by the duplication of the
  17p11.2 region that includes the PMP22 gene. Reciprocal deletion of the same
  region is the main cause of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP). CMT1A accounts for approximately 50% of HMSN patients.
  Diagnostics of CMT1A and HNPP are based on quantitative analysis of the
  affected region or RFLP detection of breakage points. The aim of this study
  was to improve the sensitivity and efficiency of CMT1A and HNPP genetic
  diagnostics by introducing analysis of six STR markers
  (D17S261-D17S122-D17S839-D17S1358-D17S955-D17S921) spanning the duplicated
  region. Forty-six CMT1A and seven HNPP patients, all genetically diagnosed by
  RFLP analysis, were tested for duplication or deletion using six STR markers.
  In all CMT1A and HNPP patients, microsatellite analysis comprising six STR
  markers confirmed the existence of a duplication or deletion. In 89% (41/46)
  CMT1A patients the confirmation was based on detecting three alleles on at
  least one locus. In the remaining 11% (5) CMT1A patients, duplication was also
  confirmed based on two peaks with clear dosage difference for at least two
  different markers. All HNPP patients (7/7) displayed only one allele for each
  analyzed locus. Microsatellite analysis using six selected STR loci showed a
  high level of sensitivity and specificity for genetic diagnostics of CMT1A and
  HNPP. The results here strongly suggest STR marker analysis as a method of
  choice in PMP22 duplication/deletion testing.
