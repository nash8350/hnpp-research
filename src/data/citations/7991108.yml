  Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy with predilection for the brachial plexus
  (HNA) and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are
  autosomal dominant disorders associated with episodic, recurrent brachial
  neuropathies. HNPP is associated with a deletion or abnormal structure of the
  PMP22 gene on chromosome 17p11.2-12. The genetic locus for HNA is unknown. To
  address the possibility that HNPP and HNA might be identical disorders or
  allelic variations at the same locus, we investigated three HNA pedigrees with
  markers from the HNPP region. We did not find the 17p11.2-12 deletion
  associated with HNPP, nor an abnormality in PMP22 structure with HNA. This
  analysis provides genetic evidence, in addition to that suggested by the
  clinical, electrophysiologic, and pathologic differences, that HNA and HNPP
  are distinct disorders.
