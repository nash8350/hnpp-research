  Tomaculous neuropathy (or hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsy [HNLPP]) is a rare and hereditary disease which incidence has probably
  been underestimated. It is characterised by demyelination resulting in
  numbness and weakness after nerve pressure, injury or stretch. Despite a
  well-documented genetic pathophysiologic mechanism, implications for
  anaesthesia in patients with HNLPP are only speculative and the use of
  regional anaesthesia is debatable. We report here the case of a patient with
  HNLPP who was followed during two consecutive pregnancies in the same hospital
  and for whom an expert of the SOS-RA hotline service was consulted before each
  delivery. For the first delivery, epidural analgesia was performed for labour
  pain control but a caesarean section was necessary because of failure to
  progress (0.0625% bupivacaine with 0.2 microg/ml sufentanil for labour then 2%
  lidocaine with adrenaline for surgery). Two years later, the patient was again
  seen for a preanaesthetic visit because elective Caesarean section was
  planned. Spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric bupivacaine and sufentanil was
  used. Both deliveries were uneventful and there were no neurologic complaints
  in the postpartum periods.
