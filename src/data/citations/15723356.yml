  during nerve regeneration.

  Altered expression of the PMP22 gene causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type
  1A (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  (HNPP). We have examined the promoter activity of 8.5 kb upstream of the first
  coding exon of the rat peripheral myelin protein-22 (rPmp22) gene in
  transgenic mice. We found that the -8.5 kb rPmp22/chloramphenicol acetyl
  transferase (CAT)/beta-galactosidase (lacZ) construct directs reporter gene
  expression in a weakly developmental and tissue-specific pattern, consistent
  with the expression pattern of the endogenous Pmp22 gene. The -8.5 kb
  rPmp22/CAT/lacZ transgene responds to loss of axonal signals during Wallerian
  degeneration but unlike the endogenous Pmp22 gene, the transgene fails to
  respond to axonal signals during nerve regeneration after a sciatic nerve
  crush injury. In conclusion, the function of the -8.5 kb rPmp22/CAT/lacZ
  transgene suggests that there are separable regulatory elements in the rPmp22
  gene that respond differently to axonal signals received by Schwann cells
  during nerve development, and during remyelination.
