  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is a disorder
  characterized by a tendency to develop focal neuropathies after trivial
  traumas. On teased nerve fiber studies, sausage-shaped myelin sheath swellings
  (tomacula) are found. We report the sonographic findings in a patient with
  genetically proven HNPP. We were able to demonstrate enlargement of several
  peripheral nerves, even nerves that were clinically unaffected. Enlargement
  was found not only at typical nerve entrapment sites but also outside these
  sites. This diffuse nerve enlargement may play an important role in the
  pathogenesis of entrapment neuropathies in HNPP patients.
