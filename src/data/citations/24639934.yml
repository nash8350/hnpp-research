  Sonographic evaluation of the peripheral nerves in hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies a case report.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominantly inherited disorder that affects peripheral nerves by
  repeated focal pressure. HNPP can be diagnosed by clinical findings,
  electrodiagnostic studies, histopathological features, and genetic analysis.
  Ultrasonography is increasingly used for the diagnosis of neuromuscular
  diseases; however, sonographic features of HNPP have not been clearly defined.
  We report the sonographic findings and comparative electrodiagnostic data in a
  73-year-old woman with HNPP, confirmed by genetic analysis. The
  cross-sectional areas of peripheral nerves were enlarged at typical nerve
  entrapment sites, but enlargement at non-entrapment sites was uncommon. These
  sonographic features may be helpful for diagnosis of HNPP when
  electrodiagnostic studies are suspicious of HNPP and/or gene study is not
  compatible.
