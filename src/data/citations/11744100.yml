  The present review summarizes observations obtained in our laboratories which
  underline the importance of neuroactive steroids (i.e., progesterone (PROG),
  dihydroprogesterone (5alpha-DH PROG), tetrahydroprogesterone (3alpha,
  5alpha-TH PROG), testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and
  5alpha-androstan-3alpha,17beta-diol (3alpha-diol)) in the control of the gene
  expression of myelin proteins (i.e. glycoprotein Po (Po) and the peripheral
  myelin protein 22 (PMP22)) in the peripheral nervous system. Utilizing
  different in vivo (aged and adult male rats) and in vitro (Schwann cell
  cultures) experimental models, we have observed that neuroactive steroids are
  able to stimulate the mRNA levels of Po and PMP22. The effects of these
  neuroactive steroids, which are able to interact with classical (progesterone
  receptor, PR, and androgen receptor, AR) and non-classical (GABA(A) receptor)
  steroid receptors is further supported by our demonstration in sciatic nerve
  and/or Schwann cells of the presence of these receptors. On the basis of the
  observations obtained in the Schwann cells cultures, we suggest that the
  stimulatory effect of neuroactive steroids on Po is acting through PR, while
  that on PMP22 needs the GABA(A) receptor. The present findings might be of
  importance for the utilization of specific receptor ligands as new
  therapeutical approaches for the rebuilding of the peripheral myelin,
  particularly in those situations in which the synthesis of Po and PMP22 is
  altered (i.e. demyelinating diseases like Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A and type
  1B, hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies and the
  Déjérine-Sottas syndrome, aging, and after peripheral injury).
