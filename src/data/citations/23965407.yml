title: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy two cases of difficult
  diagnosis.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  inherited autosomal dominant disorder that causes a polyneuropathy with
  predisposition for involvement at sites of compression and is often
  underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to its heterogeneity in clinical and
  electrophysiological presentation. We report 2 cases of HNPP, which were
  initially diagnosed and treated as either an acquired demyelinating disorder
  or alternative inherited demyelinating disorder. Thorough evaluation of repeat
  electrodiagnostic studies and genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of HNPP
  in both cases. One case showed the classic peripheral myelin protein 22
  (PMP22) deletion and the other case showed a previously reported single base
  pair deletion at Leu145 causing a frameshift mutation at the PMP22 gene. These
  cases underscore the difficulty of diagnosing HNPP, because of the variations
  in clinical and electrophysiological findings and reinforce the importance of
  a combination high index of clinical suspicion, electrodiagnostic testing, and
  genetic testing to make the diagnosis.
