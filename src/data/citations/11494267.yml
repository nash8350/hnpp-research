  Clinical, electrophysiologic and molecular studies were performed on at-risk
  members of 14 families with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP), in order to detect asymptomatic carriers of the 17p11.2
  deletion. Sporadic cases due to de novo deletion accounted for 21% of the
  investigated HNPP families. Approximately one half of deletion carriers were
  asymptomatic and did not display significant signs on clinical examination.
  The electrophysiologic hallmark in both symptomatic and asymptomatic deletion
  carriers was the presence of a nonuniform sensorimotor demyelinating
  polyneuropathy with conduction abnormalities preferentially located at common
  entrapment sites and distal nerve segments. A perfect correlation was found
  between the molecular and electrophysiologic analyses. A reliable screening
  method to detect clinically unaffected carriers of the deletion in families
  with HNPP was the evaluation of motor conduction in at least two nerves across
  usual entrapment sites, especially the ulnar nerve at the elbow, and
  evaluation of sensory conduction in the sural nerve. In sporadic cases due to
  a de novo deletion, electrophysiologic studies were suggestive but not
  sufficient for the diagnosis, and molecular analysis represented the most
  sensitive diagnostic tool.
