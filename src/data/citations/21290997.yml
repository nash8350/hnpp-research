  A 58-year-old male presented with a history of slowly progressive bilateral
  hand weakness manifested by decreased grip strength and pinch strength
  associated with some pain in the first metacarpal-carpal joints with atrophy
  of the muscles of the web space. An evaluation based on history, physical
  exam, and judicious diagnostic testing yielded a finding of motor and sensory
  peripheral polyneuropathy and a working diagnosis of hereditary nerve pressure
  palsy syndrome (HNPP) or hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies. The clinical findings and diagnostic tests for sensory and motor
  peripheral neuropathy are discussed. The case details over time, hereditary
  features, and the natural history of this disorder lead to a favorable
  clinical and insurance medicine prognosis.
