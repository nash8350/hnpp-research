  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant peripheral neuropathy caused by mutations in the peripheral
  myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. This study summarizes the clinical,
  electrophysiological, genetic, and imaging features of six unrelated Chinese
  Han patients with HNPP. Age of onset was within the second decade in five
  patients, and 46â€¯years of age in one patient. Weakness or numbness in a
  unilateral lower extremity was the most common symptom in 5 patients, and
  bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was also detected in one patient.
  Electrophysiological presentations suggested demyelinating sensory-motor
  polyneuropathy in the group. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical
  and lumbar spine revealed varying degrees of degeneration in five patients,
  and mild kyphosis of cervical vertebral bodies in 2 teen-aged patients. In
  addition, cranial MRI of one patient showed scattered demyelination in the
  frontal lobes. Targeted next-generation-sequencing (NGS) revealed a PMP22
  deletion in five patients and a heterozygous c.199G>A mutation in exon 4 of
  PMP22 in one patient. The I92V variant of lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor
  necrosis factor (LITAF) gene was found in one patient. There was no
  relationship between the Ile92Val variant of LITAF and age of onset in this
  group, albeit the sample size was very small.
