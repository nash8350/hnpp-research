  Proximal arm weakness is the most common presentation in young Korean soldiers
  diagnosed as having hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy
  (HNPP).
abstract: >-
  Because patients with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy
  (HNPP) are diagnosed mostly in their 20s, they are likely to experience their
  first major neurological symptoms during military training. We aimed to
  analyse the clinical characteristics and electrodiagnostic study findings of
  patients diagnosed with HNPP during their military service. We identified
  patients diagnosed as having HNPP in 2011-2014 and investigated their initial
  symptom presentation, the location and severity of their weakness, the
  causative event, the results of electrodiagnostic studies and the results of
  the genetic analysis of the PMP-22 gene. Among the 36 patients included in the
  study, 19 (52.8%) patients had upper extremity paraesthesia with proximal arm
  weakness caused by brachial plexus lesion. Distal upper extremity symptoms
  were found in 12 (33.3%) patients, and leg paraesthesia was present only in
  five (13.9%) patients. Among the 19 patients who had proximal arm weakness,
  the most common cause of weakness was the performance of push-ups as a
  punishment (36.8%), and strenuous push-up exercise was the second cause of
  this symptom (21.1%). Brachial plexus lesion leading to proximal arm weakness
  and paraesthesia was the most common presentation in soldiers with HNPP, and
  strenuous push-up activity was the major leading causative event in this
  condition.
