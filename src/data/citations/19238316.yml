  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies and amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis.
abstract: >-
  A 56-year-old male with recurrent painless focal neuropathies and a family
  history of peripheral neuropathy of unknown etiology presented with
  progressively worsening of impaired sensations and weakness in his lower
  extremities. His initial electrodiagnostic evaluation was suggestive of severe
  sensory and motor peripheral polyneuropathy. The genetic testing was performed
  for familial causes of peripheral neuropathy as there was a family history of
  peripheral neuropathy of unknown etiology. The patient was found to have
  1.5-Mb deletion in the PMP22 gene which was confirmatory of hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). He developed progressive
  upper and lower extremity weakness, bulbar dysfunction and widespread
  fasciculations during the course of his illness. He was subsequently diagnosed
  with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This is the second reported case of
  HNPP associated with ALS. We discuss significant clinical and
  electrodiagnostic findings of this interesting case.
