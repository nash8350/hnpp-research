  Two familial cases of recurrent brachial plexus are described and similar
  episodes were noticed in other members of the family. Electrophysiological
  investigations found impaired motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity in
  affected and nonaffected members. Tomaculous neuropathy was found at biopsy of
  peripheral nerve in more than 40% of dissected fibers. In addition, two
  affected members showed a reduced interpupillary distance, i.e. the most
  common dysmorphic feature found in the hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA).
  A literature review showed only two other instances of recurrent familial
  brachial plexus palsies as the only manifestation of tomaculous neuropathy
  (hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy, HNPP). The dysmorphic
  feature found in our cases in addition to the clinical, electrophysiological
  and anatomical data support the hypothesis that these cases of HNPP and the
  HNA may represent the same disease.
