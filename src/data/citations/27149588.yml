  Compression of Root Level in a Patient with Hereditary Neuropathy with
  Liability to Pressure Palsy Diagnosed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is
  characterized by acute, painless, and recurrent mononeuropathies that are
  secondary to compression or minor trauma. This case is the first to report an
  intraspinal compression of the radicular nerve by schwannoma in a patient with
  HNPP. A 66-year-old woman developed left foot drop and paresthesia of the
  lateral aspects of left distal lower leg. An electromyography showed left L5
  radiculopathy and severe peripheral polyneuropathy. A lumbosacral magnetic
  resonance imaging revealed a radicular nerve in the intradural and
  extramedullary space being compressed by schwannoma. She previously had
  symptoms of foot drop several years ago, and HNPP was confirmed by peripheral
  myelin protein 22 deletion. She was surgically treated for L5 radiculopathy,
  which might have been caused by a traction of the nerve root by schwannoma at
  the intradural and extramedullary space. After surgical treatment, her
  symptoms of foot drop had improved from zero grade to IV+ grade within 4
  weeks. The occurrence of HNPP and schwannoma in the same patient may be
  coincidental, but it is tempting to speculate that they share a common genetic
  basis. Therefore, for patients with HNPP, it is important to consider not only
  an electrophysiologic study but also a magnetic resonance imaging to locate
  the exact pathologic site.
