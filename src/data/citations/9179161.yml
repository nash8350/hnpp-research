  A 22-year-old male awoke with right foot drop and numbness. Nerve conduction
  studies, sural nerve biopsy, and molecular genetic analysis were consistent
  with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP). Two months
  later he developed involuntary flexion/extension movements of the right toes
  with associated intermittent dystonic flexion of the right foot. Over the next
  2 months these movements spread to the left foot and hand and myoclonus of the
  left trapezius and rhomboid appeared. This is the first case report of moving
  toes syndrome and segmental myoclonus in association with HNPP. The temporal
  and topographic patterns of spread of the abnormal movements suggest a central
  mechanism probably induced by peripheral pathology.
