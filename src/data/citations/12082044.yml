title: Inflammation and neuropathic attacks in hereditary brachial plexus neuropathy.
abstract: >-
  To study the role of mechanical, infectious, and inflammatory factors inducing
  neuropathic attacks in hereditary brachial plexus neuropathy (HBPN), an
  autosomal dominant disorder characterised by attacks of pain and weakness,
  atrophy, and sensory alterations of the shoulder girdle and upper limb
  muscles. Four patients from separate kindreds with HBPN were evaluated. Upper
  extremity nerve biopsies were obtained during attacks from a person of each
  kindred. In situ hybridisation for common viruses in nerve tissue and genetic
  testing for a hereditary tendency to pressure palsies (HNPP; tomaculous
  neuropathy) were undertaken. Two patients treated with intravenous methyl
  prednisolone had serial clinical and electrophysiological examinations. One
  patient was followed prospectively through pregnancy and during the
  development of a stereotypic attack after elective caesarean delivery. Upper
  extremity nerve biopsies in two patients showed prominent perivascular
  inflammatory infiltrates with vessel wall disruption. Nerve in situ
  hybridisation for viruses was negative. There were no tomaculous nerve
  changes. In two patients intravenous methyl prednisolone ameliorated symptoms
  (largely pain), but with tapering of steroid dose, signs and symptoms
  worsened. Elective caesarean delivery did not prevent a typical postpartum
  attack. Inflammation, probably immune, appears pathogenic for some if not all
  attacks of HBPN. Immune modulation may be useful in preventing or reducing the
  neuropathic attacks, although controlled trials are needed to establish
  efficacy, as correction of the mutant gene is still not possible. The genes
  involved in immune regulation may be candidates for causing HBPN disorders.
