  Axonal loss in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) is an important feature
  correlated with the functional disability in affected individuals. It is not
  known, however, how the most common genetic defect in Schwann cells (PMP22
  duplication) causes the CMT1A phenotype and results in axonal loss. In this
  study, sural nerve segments from individuals with PMP22 duplications or
  deletions, causing the reciprocal disorder hereditary neuropathy with pressure
  palsies (HNPP), were grafted into the cut ends of the sciatic nerve of nude
  mice. The xenografts and host segments were studied at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16
  weeks after grafting and compared with the controls from healthy volunteers.
  Within the CMT1A xenografts, the nude mice axons in the proximal part of the
  graft showed a significant increase in axonal area with an increase in the
  neurofilament and membranous organelle (mitochondria) density, compared with
  distal graft and distal host segments. A preferential distal axonal loss,
  associated with a perpetual axonal atrophy, degeneration, and axonal sprouting
  was observed over time, with increasing intensity at 8 to 16 weeks. These
  alterations were seen to a lesser extent in HNPP xenografts and were not
  observed in controls. In addition, the onset of regeneration-associated
  myelination was delayed, more significantly in HNPP xenografts than those of
  CMT1A. Our findings indicate that the PMP22 duplication in Schwann cells
  results in an impairment in the normal axonal cytoskeletal organization,
  resulting in distal axonal degeneration and fiber loss, and the affect of
  PMP22 deletion on axonal cytoskeleton is less deleterious.
