  Peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) is a major component of the peripheral
  myelin sheath. The PMP22 gene is located on chromosome 17p11.2, and defects in
  PMP22 gene have been implicated in several common inherited peripheral
  neuropathies. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP),
  Charcot-Marie Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), Dejerine-Sottas syndrome, and
  congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy are all associated with defects in PMP22
  gene. The disease phenotypes mirror the range of expression of PMP22 due to
  the corresponding genetic defect. HNPP, characterized by a milder recurrent
  episodic focal demyelinating neuropathy, is attributed to a deletion leading
  to PMP22 underexpression. On the other end of the spectrum, CMT1A leads to a
  more uniform demyelination and axonal loss, resulting in severe progressive
  distal weakness and paresthesias; it is due to a duplication at 17p11.2
  leading to PMP22 overexpression. Additional point mutations result in varying
  phenotypes due to dysfunction of the resultant PMP22 protein. All inherited
  neuropathies are diagnosed with a combination of physical findings on
  examination, electromyography, sural nerve biopsies, and genetic testing.
  Treatment and management of these disorders differ depending on the underlying
  genetic defect, nerves involved, and resulting functional impairments. A
  review of current literature elucidates clinical, microsurgical implications,
  and management of patients with PMP22-related neuropathy.
