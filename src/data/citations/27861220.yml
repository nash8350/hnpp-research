  Hereditary Neuropathy With Liability to Pressure Palsies Diverse Phenotypes in
  Childhood.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is a rare
  autosomal-dominant disorder that most commonly produces recurrent painless
  focal sensory and motor neuropathies often preceded by minor, mechanical
  stress, or minor trauma. Herein, we report 2 pediatric cases of HNPP with
  atypical presentations; isolated muscle cramping and toe walking.
  Electrophysiologic testing disclosed multifocal sensorimotor polyneuropathy
  with slowing of sensory conduction velocities in both cases, which prompted
  PMP 22 gene deletion testing. Multifocal sensorimotor electrophysiologic
  abnormalities, with slowing of sensory conduction velocities should raise
  consideration of HNPP in childhood. These case reports emphasize that the
  diagnosis of HNPP in children requires a high index of suspicion.
