title: '[Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies in childhood].'
abstract: >-
  The diagnosis of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  during childhood is uncommon, since the disorder is still asymptomatic and the
  clinical features are nonspecific. We present a case of hereditary neuropathy
  with liability to pressure palsies in a seven and a half year old girl with
  deteriorating clinical findings of 'pies cavos', scoliosis, difficulty in
  walking and torticollis, but without episodes of paralysis. On the
  electroneurographic (ENG) study numerous anomalies of sensory and motor nerve
  conduction were seen, especially at sites of nerve trapping, both in the
  patient and in her mother; genetic study showed deletions of chromosome
  17p11.2 in both. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsiesin
  childhood may follow a course which does not show typical pressure palsies.
  Therefore the ENG study is very important for detection of the disorder.
  Torticollis, as well as pies cavos and scoliosis, is frequently seen in
  neuropaediatric clinics, so the possibility, as in the case reported, that
  this is part of the clinical spectrum of hereditary neuropathy with liability
  to pressure palsies should be considered. With diagnostic confirmation on
  genetic studies, nerve biopsy is not necessary.
