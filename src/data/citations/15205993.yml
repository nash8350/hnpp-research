abstract: >-
  We describe a Cypriot family in which some family members presented with
  episodes of pressure palsies, while other family members had a slowly
  progressive chronic polyneuropathy typical of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1
  phenotype. All family members were evaluated clinically, with nerve conduction
  studies, and with genetic testing. In all affected individuals there was
  clinical and electrophysiological evidence of diffuse demyelinating
  sensorimotor polyneuropathy and a novel point mutation in the PMP22 gene
  (Ser22Phe) was identified.
