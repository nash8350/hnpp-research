  Background Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 1A (CMT,1A) is a common autosomal
  dominant neuromuscular disorder, which affects both motor and sensory function
  and is characterized usually by duplication of a region on chromosome 17
  through unequal crossover. As a result, affected patients carry three copies
  of this region. Individuals inheriting the other deleted chromosome involved
  in the crossover have one copy of the region and manifest herditary neuropathy
  with susceptibility to pressure palsies (HNPP). One diagnostic approach to
  CMT,1A exploits Southern blot hybridization and the relative intensity for
  three polymorphic MspI restriction fragment lenth polymorphism bands within
  the duplicated area to judge whether patients have two or three copies of this
  region using a probe such as VAW409R3A. This is usually straightfoward and
  works well for the majority of samples that display polymorphisms. However, it
  is difficult to judge dosage for this region in patients who do not
  demonstrate polymorphic bands. Methods and Results An assay has been developed
  in which a simultaneously hybridized probe (pH15), which detects a
  nonpolymorphic band on chromosome 22 generated by the same restriction enzyme
  used to digest genomic DNA, is used to normalize the signal from the CMT,1A
  probe after phosphorimager analysis. Normalized ratios for
  VAW409R3A-hybridizing Southern bands fell within discrete ranges for patients
  with three copies (2.72-3.69), two copies (1.60-2.40) and one copy (0.75-1.30)
  of this region in over 45 patient and control samples studied. Conclusions
  This assay appears to provide a reliable and consistent method of analysis.
