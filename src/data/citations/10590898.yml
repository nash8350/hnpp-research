title: Molecular basis of inherited neuropathies.
abstract: >-
  Considerable advances in our knowledge of the most frequently encountered
  group of inherited neuropathies, Charcot-Marie-Tooth neurpathy (CMT) and
  related disorders, have recently been made by genetic studies demonstrating
  that these disorders are caused by duplication, deletion or point mutations of
  specific genes of the peripheral myelin. The present classification of CMT and
  related disorders is based on a combination of clinical, neurophysiological,
  and genetic findings, and new genes and distinct mutations responsible for
  different clinical phenotypes are continuously being added. The genes that
  encode peripheral myelin protein of 22 kDa, protein zero, connexin-32 and
  early growth response-2 are the genes known to be involved in the pathogenesis
  of inherited neuropathies. Overexpression or underexpression of peripheral
  myelin protein of 22 kDa are causative for the most frequent forms of
  CMT-CMT1A and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies--but
  the mechanisms that lead to incorrect myelin formation and maintenance are
  still unknown. Point mutations in the myelin genes can determine a loss of
  function, but in some cases an aberrant protein can act through a dominant
  negative or a toxic gain of function mechanism, disrupting the regular and
  precise relationship between the different myelin genes. Animal and in-vitro
  models of inherited neuropathies have been developed and will probably give
  the information that is necessary to clarify the pathogenetic mechanisms of
  demyelination.
