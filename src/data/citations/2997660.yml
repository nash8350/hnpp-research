  We detected 29 conduction blocks in 12 patients with hereditary neuropathy and
  liability to pressure palsies. The blocks occurred at entrapment sites, most
  often the ulnar nerve at the elbow. Some had lasted for several years. This
  kind of block seems to be characteristic of the neuropathy, and may be related
  to the localized thickening of myelin ("tomacula"). In one patient with two
  permanent and severe blocks, neurolysis was beneficial.
