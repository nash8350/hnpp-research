  Misalignment between the two elements of the CMT1A-REP binary repeat on
  chromosome 17p11.2-p12 causes two inherited peripheral neuropathies,
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy with liability
  to pressure palsies. This binary repeat contains repetitive DNA elements that
  include LINES, SINES, medium reiteration frequency repeats, and a
  transposon-like element. The COX10 gene has been mapped 10 kb centromeric to
  the distal CMT1A-REP element, and a portion of this gene is present in both
  the proximal and the distal CMT1A-REP elements. We report the isolation and
  characterization of a novel cDNA (C170RF1), which maps centromeric to and
  partially within the proximal CMT1A-REP element. Part of C170RF1 is
  transcribed from the opposite strand of the COX10 partial gene duplication
  present in the proximal CMT1A-REP element. This finding shows that C170RF1 and
  COX10 are being transcribed from opposite strands of identical DNA sequences
  that are separated by 1.5 Mb in the genome. RT-PCR analysis showed the
  proximal transcript was expressed in skeletal muscle. Sequence analysis
  identified an open reading frame encoding a 199-amino-acid protein. Zoo blot
  analysis showed that the transcript is conserved in nonhuman primates. The
  presence of a binary repeat contributes to the instability of this region of
  chromosome 17, yet two CMT1A-REP elements are present in the chimpanzee and
  all human populations. The presence of expressed sequences in both elements of
  the CMT1A-REP binary repeat could explain the maintenance of this repeat in
  humans.
