  Molecular diagnosis of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP) by detection of 17p11.2 deletion in Italian patients.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with a liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent pressure palsies
  generally precipitated by minor trauma; weakness and paraesthesia usually
  improve and recover completely in a few months. By Southern blotting and
  fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis we confirm the presence of a
  17p11.2 deletion in familial and in isolated cases of HNPP, suggesting that
  molecular analysis of the 17p11.2 region could also be a reliable and
  non-invasive method of diagnosis in sporadic cases, where a correct diagnosis
  usually requires a nerve biopsy. Although HNPP is a mild disease and not all
  patients seek medical attention, a presymptomatic diagnosis is useful for
  assessing the risk during genetic counselling, due to the inheritance of the
  mutation.
