  A 42-year-old woman was surgically treated for carpal tunnel syndrome,
  revealing schwannoma of the median nerve. A year later, she developed a tarsal
  tunnel syndrome. At time of this diagnosis, hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) was diagnosed genetically and a
  schwannoma of the medial plantar nerve was treated surgically. The occurrence
  of HNPP and schwannomas in the same patient might be purely coincidental, but
  it is tempting to speculate that they share a common genetic basis.
