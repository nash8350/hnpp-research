  Carrying a heavy backpack exerts compression on shoulders, with the potential
  to cause brachial plexopathy. We evaluated the incidence and predisposing
  factors of compression plexopathy of the shoulder region in 152,095 military
  conscripts, hypothesizing that a low body mass index and poor physical fitness
  predispose to the plexus lesion. Reports of conscripts with neural lesions of
  the upper arm associated with load carriage were reviewed retrospectively for
  details associated with the condition onset, symptoms, signs, nerve conduction
  studies, and electromyographic examinations. Height, weight, and physical
  fitness scores were obtained from their military training data. The incidence
  of neural compression after shoulder load carriage in Finnish soldiers was
  53.7 (95% confidence interval, 39.5-67.8) per 100,000 conscripts per year. The
  long thoracic nerve was affected in 19, the axillary nerve in 13, the
  suprascapular nerve in seven, and the musculocutaneous nerve in six patients.
  Four patients (7%) had hereditary neuropathy with susceptibility to pressure
  palsies (HNPP). Symptoms were induced by lighter loads in patients with HNPP.
  Vulnerability to brachial plexopathy was not predictable from body structure
  or physical fitness level. To prevent these lesions, awareness of the
  condition and its symptoms should be increased and backpack designs should be
  improved.
