  To clarify age related changes in the clinicopathological features of
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) in Japanese
  patients with deletion of 17p11.2, particularly concerning axonal
  abnormalities. Forty eight proband patients from 48 HNPP families were
  assessed as to clinical, electrophysiological, and histopathological features,
  including age associated changes beyond those in controls. Motor conduction
  studies showed age associated deterioration of compound muscle action
  potentials in nerves vulnerable to repetitive compression (median, ulnar, and
  peroneal nerves), but not in others such as the tibial nerve. Sensory
  conduction studies revealed more profound reduction of action potentials than
  motor studies with little age related change. Large myelinated fibre loss was
  seen in the sural nerve irrespective of age at examination. Irreversible
  axonal damage may occur at entrapment sites in motor nerves in HNPP patients,
  progressing with aging. Sensory nerves may show more profound axonal
  abnormality, but without age association. The electrophysiological features of
  HNPP are presumed to be a mixture of abnormalities occurring from early in
  life and acquired features caused by repetitive insults at entrapment sites.
  Unlike Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A, age associated axonal damage may
  not occur unless the nerves are subjected to compression.
