  Objectives. Although hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  (HNPP) presents with a distinct phenotype on history, clinical exam, and nerve
  conduction studies, it may be masked if diagnostic work-up suggests other
  causes. Case Report. In a 37-year-old male with pseudoradicular lumbar pain,
  neurological exam revealed sore neck muscles, peripheral facial nerve palsy,
  right anacusis and left hypoacusis, hemihypesthesia of the right face, mild
  distal quadriparesis, diffuse wasting, and generally reduced tendon reflexes.
  He had a history of skull fracture due to a gunshot behind the right ear and
  tuberculosis for which he had received adequate treatment for 3 years; MRI
  revealed a disc prolapse at C6/7 and Th11/12. Nerve conduction studies were
  indicative of demyelinating polyneuropathy with conduction blocks. Despite
  elevated antinuclear antibodies and elevated CSF-protein, HNPP was diagnosed
  genetically after having excluded vasculitis, CIDP, radiculopathy, and the
  side effects of antituberculous treatment. Conclusions. HNPP may manifest with
  mild, painless, distal quadriparesis. The diagnosis of HNPP may be blurred by
  a history of tuberculosis, tuberculostatic treatment, hepatitis, and the
  presence of elevated CSF-protein.
