  Molecular genetics and biology of inherited peripheral neuropathies a
  fast-moving field.
abstract: >-
  The recent progress of molecular genetics has considerably increased our
  knowledge about the underlying disease mechanism of inherited peripheral
  neuropathies. Mutations in three genes coding for the myelin proteins
  peripheral myelin protein 22, myelin protein zero and connexin 32 and in one
  gene coding for the transcription factor early growth response 2 element are
  associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 and 2, hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome and congenital
  hypomyelination. This review focuses on the correlation of the different human
  phenotypes associated with distinct mutations with those found in cellular and
  animal models.
