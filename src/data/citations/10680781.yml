title: Hereditary recurrent focal neuropathies clinical and molecular features.
abstract: >-
  The authors review the molecular genetics and pathophysiology of hereditary
  recurrent focal neuropathies hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP) and hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA). Significant progress
  in the understanding of HNPP and HNA has been achieved. HNPP and HNA are
  distinct clinical and pathologic disease entities with autosomal dominant
  inheritance. Molecular genetic studies have shown that HNPP and HNA are
  located on chromosome 17 but at distinct genetic loci (17p11.2 for HNPP, 17q25
  for HNA). The 1.5 megabase deletion in 17p11.2 is the major cause of HNPP.
  This interstitial deletion causes the complete loss of one allele of the
  peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. Interestingly, rare HNPP patients
  are found without the 1.5 megabase deletion. However, these patients have
  distinct mutations in the PMP22 gene resulting in altered expression of the
  PMP22 protein. Current molecular genetic tests and clinical guidelines allow
  improved diagnosis, prognosis, and genetic counseling for patients with HNPP.
  Such tests are not available for HNA, because the disease-causing gene remains
  unknown. Molecular genetic advances in HNPP and HNA, as well as the study of
  transgenic animal and cellular models, will provide a more precise
  understanding of the disease mechanisms and will lead to the development of
  effective therapeutic tools for patients with inherited and sporadic recurrent
  peripheral neuropathies.
