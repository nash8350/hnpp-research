  To describe the neuropathological features of clinical syndromes associated
  with tomacula or focal myelin swellings in sural nerve biospies and to discuss
  possible common aetiopathological pathways leading to their formation in this
  group of neuropathies. Fifty two patients with sural nerve biopsies reported
  to show tomacula or focal myelin swellings were reviewed, light and electron
  microscopy were performed, and tomacula were analysed on teased fibre studies.
  Molecular genetic studies were performed on those patients who were available
  for genetic testing. Thirty seven patients were diagnosed with hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), four with hereditary
  motor and sensory neuropathy type I (HMSN I) or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
  type 1 (CMT1), four with HMSN with myelin outfolding (CMT4B), three with IgM
  paraproteinemic neuropathy, three with chronic inflammatory demyelinating
  polyneuropathy (CIDP), and one with HMSN III (CMT3). Most of these syndromes
  were shown to be related to genetic or immunological defects of myelin
  components such as peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22), myelin protein zero
  (P0), or myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG). These proteins share the HNK-1
  epitope which has been implicated in cell adhesion processes. Impaired myelin
  maintenance may therefore contribute to the formation of tomacula and
  subsequent demyelination.
