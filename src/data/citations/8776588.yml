  The CMT1A-REP repeat on chromosome 17p11.2-12 is proposed to mediate
  misalignment and meiotic unequal crossover leading to a 1.5 Mb pair
  duplication associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 1A (CMT1A) and
  a reciprocal deletion associated with hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP). Restriction enzyme endonuclease mapping indicated
  that the size of the CMT1A-REP repeat is approximately 24 kb and DNA sequence
  analysis determined that the repeat is flanked by inverted Alu sequences. Full
  length Alu sequences are present at the centromeric ends of the proximal and
  distal CMT1A-REP repeats and at the telomeric end of the distal repeat. A
  truncated Alu sequence is present at the telomeric end of the proximal repeat
  suggesting that the distal CMT1A-REP repeat is the progenitor copy. The
  crossover breakpoints for a series of unrelated CMT1A and HNPP patients were
  mapped using a variant SacI site found only in the proximal CMT1A-REP repeat.
  Seventy-six percent (66/85) of patients had breakpoints which mapped to a 3.2
  kb interval, providing further evidence for a recombinational hotspot within
  the CMT1A-REP repeat. A mariner-like element was mapped within the CMT1A-REP
  repeat approximately 700 bp centromeric to the 3.2 kb interval containing the
  hotspot. Analysis of this sequence suggested that it does not encode a
  functional transposon. By Northern blot analysis a cloned fragment from the
  CMT1A-REP repeat containing the mariner-like sequence detected a 2.2 kb
  transcript only in testis. Two cDNA clones which contain the mariner-like
  element were isolated from a human testis cDNA library. These clones which are
  interrupted by Alu and other repeats appear to be non-functional versions of
  the transposon. The functional relationship of the mariner-like element to the
  recombinational hotspot remains unknown. The origin of the CMT1A-REP repeat
  was investigated through an analysis of homologous sequences in non-human
  primates. Southern blot analysis indicated that the chimpanzee has two copies
  of a CMT1A-REP-like sequence, whereas gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon have a
  single copy. A high degree of conservation amongst non-human primates for
  restriction fragments specific to the human distal CMT1A-REP repeat provides
  further evidence that the distal repeat is the progenitor copy. The
  mariner-like sequence was detected in association with the CMT1A-REP sequence
  in all primates studied suggesting that the mariner-like element was
  introduced into the progenitor CMT1A-REP sequence prior to emergence of the
  proximal and distal CMT1A-REP repeats. These observations suggest that
  CMT1A-REP sequence appeared as a repeat before the divergence of chimpanzee
  and human, but after gorilla and human around 6 to 7 million years ago.
