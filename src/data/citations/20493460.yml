title: >-
  Mechanisms for nonrecurrent genomic rearrangements associated with CMT1A or
  HNPP rare CNVs as a cause for missing heritability.
abstract: >-
  Genomic rearrangements involving the peripheral myelin protein gene (PMP22) in
  human chromosome 17p12 are associated with neuropathy duplications cause
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), whereas deletions lead to
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). Our previous
  studies showed that >99% of these rearrangements are recurrent and mediated by
  nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Rare copy number variations (CNVs)
  generated by nonrecurrent rearrangements also exist in 17p12, but their
  underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We investigated 21 subjects
  with rare CNVs associated with CMT1A or HNPP by oligonucleotide-based
  comparative genomic hybridization microarrays and breakpoint sequence
  analyses, and we identified 17 unique CNVs, including two genomic deletions,
  ten genomic duplications, two complex rearrangements, and three small exonic
  deletions. Each of these CNVs includes either the entire PMP22 gene, or
  exon(s) only, or ultraconserved potential regulatory sequences upstream of
  PMP22, further supporting the contention that PMP22 is the critical gene
  mediating the neuropathy phenotypes associated with 17p12 rearrangements.
  Breakpoint sequence analysis reveals that, different from the predominant NAHR
  mechanism in recurrent rearrangement, various molecular mechanisms, including
  nonhomologous end joining, Alu-Alu-mediated recombination, and
  replication-based mechanisms (e.g., FoSTeS and/or MMBIR), can generate
  nonrecurrent 17p12 rearrangements associated with neuropathy. We document a
  multitude of ways in which gene function can be altered by CNVs. Given the
  characteristics, including small size, structural complexity, and location
  outside of coding regions, of selected rare CNVs, their identification remains
  a challenge for genome analysis. Rare CNVs may potentially represent an
  important portion of "missing heritability" for human diseases.
