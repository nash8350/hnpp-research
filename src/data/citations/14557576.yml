  The authors report an Italian family with autosomal-dominant
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) in which there were giant axons in the sural
  nerve biopsy. Linkage to the known CMT2 loci (CMT2A, CMT2B, CMT2D, CMT2F) and
  mutations in the known CMT2 genes (Cx32, MPZ, NEFL), GAN, NEFM, and CMT1A
  duplication/HNPP deletion were excluded. This family with CMT and giant axons
  has a pathologic and genetic entity distinct from classic CMT.
