  Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA) belongs to the group of recurrent focal
  neuropathies, the other major representative being hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies. The search for the HNA gene has now focused on
  a locus on chromosome 17q24-q25. Most HNA families show linkage to this locus,
  but recent evidence indicates that HNA is genetically heterogeneous. Detailed
  analysis of these unlinked families has broadened our perception of the HNA
  phenotype, and currently two different clinical courses can be discerned the
  classical relapsing-remitting course and a chronic undulating course. After 5
  years of molecular genetic research, this disease remains enigmatic. At
  present, we can only speculate how such very diverse stimuli as immunizations,
  childbirth, infections, strenuous exercise, and immobilization can trigger
  painful attacks of brachial plexus palsies in genetically susceptible
  individuals.
