  Recent progress in human genetics and neurobiology has led to the
  identification of various mutations in particular myelin genes as the cause
  for many of the known inherited demyelinating peripheral neuropathies.
  Mutations in 3 distinct myelin genes, PMP22, P0, and connexin 32 cause the 3
  major demyelinating subtypes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, CMT1A,
  CMT1B and CMTX, respectively. In addition, a reduction in the gene dosage of
  PMP22 causes hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP),
  while particular point mutations in PMP22 and P0 cause the severe
  Dejerine-Sottas (DS) neuropathy. A series of spontaneous and genetically
  engineered rodent mutants for genes for the above-mentioned myelin
  constituents are now available and their suitability to serve as models for
  these still untreatable diseases is an issue of particular interest. The
  spontaneous mutants Trembler-J and Trembler, with point mutations in PMP22,
  reflect some of the pathological alterations seen in CMT1A and DS patients,
  respectively. Furthermore, engineered mutants that either over or underexpress
  particular myelin genes are suitable models for patients who are similarly
  compromised in the gene dosage of the corresponding genes. In addition,
  engineered mutants heterozygously or homozygously deficient in the myelin
  component P0 show the pathology of distinct CMT1B and DS patients,
  respectively, while Cx32 deficient mice develop pathological abnormalities
  similar to those of CMTX patients. Mutants that mimic human peripheral
  neuropathies might allow the development of strategies to alleviate the
  symptoms of the diseases, and help to define environmental risk factors for
  aggravation of the disease. In addition, such mutants might be instrumental in
  the development of strategies to cure the diseases by gene therapy.
