  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is a rare
  nosological entity with 4 characteristics autosomal dominant inheritance;
  clinical presentation as mononeuropathy simplex or multiplex, often related to
  minor trauma; significant slowing of motor and sensory conduction in both
  clinically affected and unaffected nerves; and characteristic morphological
  findings on sural nerve biopsy, including "tomaculous" swelling of myelin
  sheaths, transnodal myelination and segmental demyelination. The pathogenesis
  of HNPP is unknown. Clinical and neuropathological investigations were carried
  out in 7 members of a family with HNPP, and sural nerve biopsy in 1. The
  findings are related to those of about 50 families published in the
  literature.
