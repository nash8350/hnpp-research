  We report two patients with suspected hereditary liability to pressure
  palsies. Neurophysiological studies showed a mixed axonal-demyelinating
  sensory-motor polyneuropathy with focal slowing of conduction velocities at
  the common sites of entrapment. Morphological studies on sural nerve biopsy
  from the proband showed active axonal regeneration without typical tomacula.
  Molecular analysis confirmed the presence of a deletion of chromosome 17p11.2
  in both patients. Our observation confirms the heterogeneity of hereditary
  liability to pressure palsies and the relevance of DNA testing for the
  diagnosis of this hereditary neuropathy.
