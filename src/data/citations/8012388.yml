abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) has been a
  associated with a deletion of 1.5 megabases of chromosome 17p. One of four
  biopsy proven HNPP families that we have studied did not possess this
  deletion. As the deleted DNA region includes the coding region for a
  peripheral myelin gene (PMP22), we used single strand conformation analysis to
  examine this gene for mutations in the non-deleted HNPP family. An abnormal
  fragment in exon 1 was identified, and sequencing revealed a two base pair
  deletion in all affected family members. The deletion results in a frame
  shift, providing strong evidence that this gene has an important role in the
  pathogenesis of the disease.
