title: Perineurium talin immunoreactivity decreases in diabetic neuropathy.
abstract: >-
  We studied the immunolocalization of Dp116 (a 116 kDa protein product of the
  dystrophin gene), vinculin, talin, vimentin, desmin, spectrin and titin in the
  sural nerve biopsies of 25 patients with peripheral neuropathies of different
  origin. 4 patients presented with HMSN type 1, 4 with HMSN type 2, 2 with
  HNPP, 4 with CIDP, 5 with chronic axonal neuropathy of unknown origin, 3 with
  vasculitic neuropathy, 3 with diabetic neuropathy. Expression and localization
  of Dp116, vinculin, vimentin, desmin, spectrin and titin did not differ from
  normal control cases. Spectrin and titin immunoreactivities were absent and
  desmin was occasionally found in few epineurial vessels. A thin rim of Dp116
  binding surrounded the outermost layer of myelin sheaths. Perineurium and
  epineurial vessels stained deeply for vinculin. Vimentin immunoreactivity was
  seen in all endoneurial, perineurial and epineurial cells. Immunoreactivity
  for talin was normally found at endoneurial and epineurial vessel walls,
  perineurial cells and epineurial fibroblasts in all the sural nerves except
  diabetic nerves. In the latter, whereas talin binding was normal in the vessel
  walls and epineurial fibroblasts, it was markedly reduced in the perineurium.
  On immunoblot, two bands at 235 and 190 kDa were found in the sural nerves
  with the antibody anti-talin, and both were reduced only in the patients with
  diabetic neuropathy. We postulate that decreased perineurium talin in diabetic
  polyneuropathy may be related to the known alterations of the tight junctions
  of the perineurial cells, which have been proposed to be a contributory factor
  to impaired permeability barrier properties.
