title: Genetic basis of inherited peripheral neuropathies.
abstract: >-
  Progress in the elucidation of the genetic basis for inherited peripheral
  neuropathies has been remarkable over the last years. In particular, the
  molecular mechanisms underlying the autosomal dominantly inherited disorders
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type
  1B (CMT1B), and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  (HNPP) have been determined. While mutation in the gene encoding the major
  myelin protein, P0 has been associated with CMT1B, CMT1A and HNPP have been
  shown to be associated with reciprocal recombination events leading either to
  a large submicroscopic duplication in CMT1A, or the corresponding DNA deletion
  in HNPP. Available evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that one or more
  genes within the relevant rearranged segment of 1.5 Mb on chromosome 17 is
  sensitive to gene dosage providing a novel mechanism for inherited human
  disorders. It is likely that the gene encoding the peripheral myelin protein
  PMP22 is at least one of the genes involved since the PMP22 gene maps within
  the CMT1A duplication (or HNPP deletion), and point mutations within it have
  been shown to cause a CMT phenotype in humans and comparable neuropathies in
  rodents (trembler and tremblerJ). The mechanism(s) by which gene dosage and
  point mutations affecting the same gene might lead to a similar phenotype are
  currently unknown but recent transgenic mouse experiments suggest that similar
  mechanisms may also underlie other genetic diseases.
