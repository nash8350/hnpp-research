  Rapid detection of 17p11.2 rearrangements by FISH without cell culture (direct
  FISH, DFISH) a prospective study of 130 patients with inherited peripheral
  neuropathies.
abstract: >-
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease and hereditary neuropathy with pressure
  palsies (HNPP) are two frequent hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies. CMT
  is characterized by slowly progressive weakness and atrophy, primarily in
  peroneal and distal leg muscles. The most frequent form, CMT1A, is due, in
  most cases, to the duplication of a 1.5 Mb region on chromosome 17p11.2
  containing the peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (PMP22). The phenotype seems
  to result from dosage of the PMP22 gene. This hypothesis is reinforced by the
  existence of HNPP, which is clinically characterized by various recurrent
  truncular palsies or sensory loss precipitated by minor trauma, which is
  caused by deletion of the same 1.5 Mb region in 17p11.2. In clinical practice,
  the detection of the duplication or the deletion in 17p11.2, which permits a
  positive diagnosis, is still performed by time consuming methods (Southern
  blot or various combinations of molecular tools). We developed a method for
  the rapid detection of 17p11.2 rearrangements, using "direct FISH" and PRINS
  analyses, which does not require cell culture. In a prospective study of 92
  patients with CMT and 38 with suspected HNPP, we compared this new technique
  to classical strategies like Southern blot. The results demonstrate the high
  sensitivity and specificity of the new FISH technique for the diagnosis of
  CMT1A and HNPP. Moreover, because of its simplicity and rapidity, this
  technique provides a useful alternative to the molecular approaches that have
  been used to diagnose segmental aneusomies, especially in the case of
  duplications that often go undetected.
