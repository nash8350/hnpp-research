  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant peripheral neuropathy characterized by recurrent episodes
  of nerve palsies. We have analyzed 11 microsatellite markers from chromosome
  17p12 --> p11 in nine French families with HNPP. The three microsatellites
  D17S839 (afm200yb12), D17S955 (afm317ygl), and D17S921 (afm191xh12) were
  localized in the deleted region. In allele segregation analyses, the
  microsatellite D17S793 (afm165zd4) detected two chromosome 17-linked loci, one
  of which was deleted in HNPP patients. Using these STR markers, we found that
  the deletion coincided with the CMT1A/HNPP monomer unit in eight of the nine
  families. In the remaining pedigree, the deletion lay between the centromeric
  microsatellite D17S805 (afm234tal) and the telomeric marker D17S922
  (afm197xh6), which flank the CMT1A monomer unit. Comparison of these data with
  the available genetic and physical maps of 17p12 --> p11 shows that this
  region, which is frequently subject to rearrangement-inducing diseases, such
  as Smith-Magenis syndrome, Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A, and HNPP, presents
  recombination hot spots. Finally, this study demonstrates the usefulness of
  the D17S122 (RM11GT) and D17S921 (afm191xh12) microsatellites as tools for the
  molecular diagnosis of HNPP.
