  To investigate the clinical and electrophysiologic phenotype of
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) Type 2 in a large number of affected
  families. We excluded CMT Type 1, hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies, and CMT due to Cx32 gene mutations by DNA analysis. We
  performed genetic analysis of the presently known CMT Type 2 genes. Sixty-one
  persons from 18 families were affected. Ninety percent of patients were able
  to walk with or without the help of aids. Proximal leg muscle weakness was
  present in 13%. Asymmetrical features were present in 15%. Normal or brisk
  knee reflexes were present in 36%. Extensor plantar responses without
  associated spasticity occurred in 10 patients from eight families. Only three
  causative mutations were identified in the MFN2, BSCL2, and RAB7 genes. No
  mutations were found in the NEFL, HSPB1, HSPB8, GARS, DNM2, and GDAP1 genes.
  At group level, the clinical phenotype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT)
  Type 2 is uniform, with symmetric, distal weakness, atrophy and sensory
  disturbances, more pronounced in the legs than in the arms, notwithstanding
  the genetic heterogeneity. Brisk reflexes, extensor plantar responses, and
  asymmetrical muscle involvement can be considered part of the CMT Type 2
  phenotype. The causative gene mutation was found in only 17% of the families
  we studied.
