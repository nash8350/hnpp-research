abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is usually due to
  PMP22 deletion. Point mutations of PMP22 causing an hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies phenotype are rare. We describe a clinical and
  electrodiagnostic phenotype of hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies in a 21-year-old woman, which led to our detecting a novel
  frameshift mutation of PMP22. This mutation was also found in her mother and
  brother and corresponded to an insertion of one cytidine between nucleotides
  433 and 434 in the last coding exon (c.433_434insC). The mutated PMP22 protein
  lacks the last 15 amino acids and has a modified C terminus lengthened to 221
  residues instead of 160 (Leu145fsX222). The mother and the proband had a
  clinical and electrophysiological hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies phenotype. The brother was asymptomatic, but the results of
  electrodiagnostic tests were suggestive of hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies. This observation of a new mutation mostly
  leading to a PMP22 haploinsufficiency provides further evidence of the
  diversity of phenotypes associated with frameshift PMP22 mutations.
