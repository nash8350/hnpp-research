  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is most
  frequently caused by deletion of a 1.4-Mb region in chromosome 17p11.2-12
  including the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. Smaller deletions
  partially affecting the PMP22 gene are less frequently observed. We identified
  in a HNPP patient a deletion of the 5' region of PMP22 including non-coding
  exon 1, coding exons 2 and 3, whereas, exons 4 and 5 were present. PMP22 exon
  3- and 4-specific qPCR resulted in a deletion of one exon 3 allele but in the
  presence of 2 exon 4 alleles. SNP analysis revealed the presence of
  heterozygosity for PMP22 coding exons 4 and 5. Finally, MLPA specific for the
  CMT1A region defined this deletion for the entire 5' region of PMP22 (exons 1,
  2 and 3). These partial HNPP deletions may be missed by other techniques,
  e.g., STR marker analysis. Alu elements have been reported to mediate
  non-allelic recombination events. Bioinformatic analysis revealed 12 Alu
  elements flanking in close neighbourhood the estimated 40-kb deletion region
  as candidates for recombination events. PCR primers were designed to identify
  a breakpoint-spanning product including the respective Alu elements.
  PCR-driven identification of a junction fragment was successful with
  AluJo-AluSq and AluYb9-AluSq specific primer pairs comprising the same
  intronic region of PMP22. Sequence analysis of these breakpoint-overlapping
  PCR fragments revealed a 29-bp motif including a chi-like sequence (GCTGG)
  present both in the AluYb9 and the AluSq element. These data confirm that
  low-copy repeats (LCRs) mediate non-allelic homologous recombinations (NAHR).
