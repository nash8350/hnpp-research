  Japanese hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP)
  patients have a deletion of one peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22) gene
  region in distal chromosome band 17p11.2 as do Caucasian patients. Japanese
  and Asiatic Indian CMT1A patients have a PMP22 gene duplication that results
  in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type IA (CMT1A; HMSNIA) in patients of European
  and Middle Eastern ancestry. About 70% of Japanese CMT1 patients have a PMP22
  duplication as do Caucasians, while Japanese CMT1B, CMT2 and Dejerine-Sottas
  patients to not have PMP22 gene region aneuploidy. Although HNPP and CMT1A
  genotypes are generated simultaneously by unequal recombination that results
  in PMP22 gene aneuploidy in each daughter cell, only 3 Japanese HNPP probands
  with PMP22 deletion from a large patient population were referred to a single
  center compared to 18 referred CMT1A probands with PMP22 duplication. This
  lower HNPP frequency more likely reflects lower HNPP reproductive fitness than
  patient ascertainment bias because disease severity and variation in severity
  is about the same in CMT1A and HNPP patients and because all patients of both
  types were referred regardless of disease severity. These results, along with
  an apparently high de novo CMT1A mutation rate, suggest that common ancestors
  of Japanese, Asian Indians, and Caucasians carried PMP22 geneflanking
  sequences that enhance unequal crossing over.
