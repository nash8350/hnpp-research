  Human meiotic recombination products revealed by sequencing a hotspot for
  homologous strand exchange in multiple HNPP deletion patients.
abstract: >-
  The HNPP (hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies) deletion
  and CMT1A (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A) duplication are the reciprocal
  products of homologous recombination events between misaligned flanking
  CMT1A-REP repeats on chromosome 17p11. 2-p12. A 1.7-kb hotspot for homologous
  recombination was previously identified wherein the relative risk of an
  exchange event is 50 times higher than in the surrounding 98.7% identical
  sequence shared by the CMT1A-REPs. To refine the region of exchange further,
  we designed a PCR strategy to amplify the recombinant CMT1A-REP from HNPP
  patients as well as the proximal and distal CMT1A-REPs from control
  individuals. By comparing the sequences across recombinant CMT1A-REPs to that
  of the proximal and distal CMT1A-REPs, the exchange was mapped to a 557-bp
  region within the previously identified 1.7-kb hotspot in 21 of 23 unrelated
  HNPP deletion patients. Two patients had recombined sequences suggesting an
  exchange event closer to the mariner-like element previously identified near
  the hotspot. Five individuals also had interspersed patches of proximal or
  distal repeat specific DNA sequence indicating potential gene conversion
  during the exchange of genetic material. Our studies provide a direct
  observation of human meiotic recombination products. These results are
  consistent with the hypothesis that minimum efficient processing segments,
  which have been characterized in Escherichia coli, yeast, and cultured
  mammalian cells, may be required for efficient homologous meiotic
  recombination in humans.
