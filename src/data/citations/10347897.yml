  Direct in situ PCR with HNPP/Fast Red TR was used to enumerate bacteria
  carrying the sltII gene in river water. By direct in situ PCR with a
  sltII-specific EVS primer, 10(2)-10(5) cells ml-1 of bacteria carrying the
  sltII gene were detected from all sampling sites, except the site nearest to
  the source of the river, while 10(2)-10(4) cells ml-1 of Escherichia coli
  O157H7 were detected using a direct fluorescent antibody staining method.
  These results indicate that such bacteria are commonly distributed in natural
  river water. Direct in situ PCR with HNPP/Fast Red TR is a useful tool for
  detecting cells carrying specific genes, such as verotoxin-producing bacteria
  in natural environments.
