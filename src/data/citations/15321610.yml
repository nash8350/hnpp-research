  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is a rare but
  probably under-diagnosed disorder of peripheral nerves in which individuals
  suffer from repeated motor and sensory neuropathies (pressure palsies)
  following brief nerve compression or mild trauma. A seemingly trivial insult
  such as sitting or kneeling may result in a focal neurological deficit lasting
  for hours to months. Despite the growing recognition of this problem,
  information regarding the anaesthetic management of labour is sparse. We
  present a woman with HNPP who was provided with a modified epidural regimen
  (low concentration bupivacaine and fentanyl) for analgesia in labour and
  delivery. Labour progressed uneventfully and there were no neurological
  sequelae following delivery.
