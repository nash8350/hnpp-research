  Clinical, neurophysiological and pathological investigations were carried out
  in 11 affected members of 2 families with hereditary neuropathy with liability
  to pressure palsies (HNPP). The observations were related to findings in 261
  cases of 47 families published in the literature. It was concluded that HNPP
  is a nosological entity characterized by the following diagnostic criteria (1)
  an autosomal dominant inheritance; (2) the clinical presentation of a
  recurrent mononeuropathy simplex or multiplex, frequently related to an
  inadequate trauma to peripheral nerves; (3) a significant slowing of motor and
  sensory conduction velocity in clinically affected, but also in clinically
  unaffected nerves; (4) characteristic morphological findings in sural nerve
  biopsy featuring "tomaculous" swellings of myelin sheaths, transnodal
  myelination and segmental demyelination. The pathogenesis of HNPP is not
  clear. Hypothetical explanations of the pathogenesis of HNPP are discussed.
