  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent mononeuropathies or
  brachial plexopathies, commonly associated with a chromosome 17p11.2-12
  deletion encompassing the peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22) gene. We tried
  to identify criteria distinguishing HNPP among patients with acute painless
  mononeuropathy/plexopathy. We investigated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
  the presence of the deletion in 27 patients with isolated or recurrent acute
  painless mononeuropathy or brachial plexopathy, and no obvious cause of
  neuropathy. Eight patients carried the deletion, whereas 19 had neither the
  deletion nor mutations in the PMP22 gene. Age at onset, presenting modality,
  precipitating events, and rate of recovery did not significantly differ in the
  two groups. Family history was informative for HNPP diagnosis in 3 cases only.
  HNPP patients more often showed recurrent episodes, brachial plexopathy, and
  clinical or electrophysiologic involvement of other nerves. Non-HNPP patients
  more frequently had peroneal palsy, recent weight loss, and normal
  electrophysiologic examination in other nerves. Signs of generalized
  neuropathy and evidence of disease in other family member are often subtle in
  HNPP and must be thoroughly investigated in patients with acute painless
  mononeuropathy/plexopathy.
