  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) syndrome type 1 and tomaculous neuropathy, also
  called hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP),
  represent two groups of neurological disorders with different subtypes, which
  can be distinguished at the molecular level. It is known that a 1.5-mb region
  on chromosome 17p11.2-12, which includes the gene for the peripheral myelin
  protein 22 kDa (PMP22), is duplicated in more than 95% of patients with CMT
  type 1A (CMT1A; gene dosage 3) and is deleted in about 90% of subjects
  suffering from HNPP (gene dosage 1). This duplication/deletion can be detected
  reliably by interphase-two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We
  report here a technique for extraction of nuclei from paraffin-embedded and
  cryofixed sural nerve biopsies for precise molecular diagnosis, employing
  interphase-two-color FISH in clinically diagnosed CMT1 or HNPP patients.
  Following this technique we were able to identify six CMT1A duplications in 13
  clinically diagnosed CMT1 cases and five HNPP deletions in 6 clinically
  diagnosed HNPP cases; 8 control persons were included in this study. This is
  the first report on the use of FISH in the detection of 17p11.2-12 duplication
  and deletion in archival biopsy material.
