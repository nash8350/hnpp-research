  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies distinguishing
  clinical and electrophysiological features among patients with multiple
  entrapment neuropathy.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is caused by deletion
  of the PMP-22 gene. As its relatively mild symptoms may escape detection by
  clinical examination alone, we screened the gene in patients with multiple
  entrapment neuropathy (MEN) that had been diagnosed by nerve conduction
  studies (NCS). Two of the eight patients with MEN had deletion of the gene.
  The characteristic features that distinguished them from the other MEN
  patients were predominantly sensory deficits associated with mild weakness and
  subclinical polyneuropathy as detected by NCS.
