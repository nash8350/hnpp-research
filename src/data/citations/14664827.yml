  Genetic disease mechanisms in the demyelinating peripheral neuropathies
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMTA) and hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) as well as transgenic animals with
  altered PMP22 gene dosage revealed that alterations in PMP22 gene expression
  have profound effects on the development and maintenance of peripheral nerves.
  Consequently, the regulation of PMP22 is a crucial aspect in understanding the
  function of this protein in health and disease. In this study, we dissected
  and analyzed different cis-acting elements in the 5'-flanking region of the
  Pmp22 gene in vivo. We found two separate elements that contribute to
  different aspects of Pmp22 expression. The first is located 5' distally to
  promoter 1 and is involved in gene regulation during late phases of
  myelination in development ["late myelination Schwann cell-specific element"
  (LMSE)] and in remyelination after injury. The second element was identified
  upstream of promoter 2 and guides Pmp22 expression in sensory neurons. These
  results suggest that multiple distinct signaling pathways regulating Pmp22
  expression in myelination as well as in neurons converge on distinct segments
  of the PMP22 promoter region. The underlying molecular mechanisms are likely
  to be crucially involved in the maintenance of the integrity of myelinated
  peripheral nerves.
