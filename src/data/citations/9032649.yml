  Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 disease (CMT1) and hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are common inherited disorders of the
  peripheral nervous system. The majority of CMT1 patients have a 1.5Mb tandem
  duplication (CMT1A) in chromosome 17p11.2 while most HNPP patients have a
  deletion of the same 1.5 Mb region. The CMT1A duplication and HNPP deletion
  are the reciprocal products of an unequal crossing over event between
  misaligned flanking CMT1A-REP elements. We analysed 162 unrelated CMT1A
  duplication patients and HNPP deletion patients from 11 different countries
  for the presence of a recombination hotspot in the CMT1A-REP sequences. A
  hotspot for unequal crossing over between the misaligned flanking CMT1A-REP
  elements was observed through the detection of novel junction fragments in
  76.9% of 130 unrelated CMT1A patients and in 71.9% of 32 unrelated HNPP
  patients. This recombination hotspot was also detected in eight out of 10 de
  novo CMT1A duplication and in two de novo HNPP deletion patients. These data
  indicate that the hotspot of unequal crossing over occurs in several
  populations independently of ethnic background and is directly involved in the
  pathogenesis of CMT1A and HNPP. We conclude that the detection of junction
  fragments from the CMT1A-REP element on Southern blot analysis is a simple and
  reliable DNA diagnostic tool for the identification of the CMT1A duplication
  and HNPP deletion in most patients.
