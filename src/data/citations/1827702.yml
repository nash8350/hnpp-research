  Clinical and electrodiagnostic findings, nerve biopsy and blood group markers
  in a family with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.
abstract: >-
  Clinical, electrophysiologic and biopsy findings as well as studies of blood
  group markers in a family with hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP) are reported. There was an autosomal dominant trait
  without genetic linkage between the HNPP gene and blood group markers
  controlled by chromosome 1. Reduced motor and sensory nerve conduction
  velocity was found in clinically affected and unaffected nerves.
  Characteristic morphological changes in sural nerve biopsy including
  tomaculous swelling were present.
