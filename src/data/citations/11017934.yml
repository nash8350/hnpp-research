  Rapid real-time fluorescent PCR gene dosage test for the diagnosis of DNA
  duplications and deletions.
abstract: >-
  Current methods to determine gene dosage are time-consuming and
  labor-intensive. We describe a new and rapid method to assess gene copy number
  for identification of DNA duplications or deletions occurring in
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), respectively. We studied 16 patients
  with HNPP, 4 with CMT1A, and 49 control subjects. We used real-time PCR on the
  LightCycler system with use of a single capillary tube and no post-PCR
  handling. A polymorphic fragment of the PMP22 gene was amplified to determine
  gene dosage for heterozygous samples. The presence of two alleles was used to
  indicate that no deletion was present in HNPP samples. The ratio obtained
  between the areas under each allele melting curve of heterozygous CMT1A
  samples was used to determine whether the sequence was duplicated or normal.
  Homozygous samples required a competitive gene dosage test, where the ratio
  between the areas under the melting curves of the target DNA of samples and of
  the competitor molecule was used to determine whether the target sequence was
  duplicated, deleted, or normal. Samples from HNPP, CMT1A, and controls were
  analyzed. Area ratios were approximately 0.6, 1.0, and 2.0 for HNPP, control,
  and CMT1A samples, respectively. The results agreed with those obtained by
  Southern blotting and microsatellite analysis in the same samples. Direct and
  competitive real-time fluorescent PCR can differentiate one, two, or three
  copies of the target DNA. The method described is sensitive and accurate for
  detection of CMT1A duplications and HNPP deletions and is faster and easier
  than current methods.
