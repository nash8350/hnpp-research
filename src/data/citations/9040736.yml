abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is associated
  with a deletion in chromosome 17p11.2, including the gene for the peripheral
  myelin protein 22 (PMP-22). Because of the proposal that a decreased dosage of
  the PMP-22 gene was the cause of HNPP, we evaluated sural nerves from eight
  patients with the 17p11.2 deletion and from five normal controls. The relative
  amount of PMP-22 mRNA was significantly lower in HNPP patients compared with
  normal controls (p < 0.02) using a semiquantitative reverse
  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. There was no significant decrease of
  Pzero mRNA. Sural nerves from HNPP patients showed normal immunostaining with
  monoclonal antibodies against PMP-22, Pzero, and myelin basic protein, and
  only rare myelinated fibers, classified as "tomacula," showed a patchy
  staining of the compact myelin with monoclonal antibody against PMP-22. The
  significant underexpression of PMP-22 mRNA in HNPP patients compared with
  normal controls demonstrates that a decreased dosage of the PMP-22 gene is the
  most likely pathogenetic mechanism in HNPP.
