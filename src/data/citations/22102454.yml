  Sonographic features in hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies.
abstract: >-
  Diagnostic nerve ultrasound is becoming more commonly used by both
  radiologists and clinicians. The features of different neuromuscular
  conditions must be described to broaden our understanding and ability to
  interpret findings. Our study examines the sonographic features of 7 subjects
  with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) in
  comparison to 32 controls by measuring the nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) of
  the median, ulnar and tibial nerves. Significant differences (P < 0.05) in
  nerve size were found. The HNPP group had a larger CSA for the median nerve at
  the wrist and ulnar nerve at the elbow (entrapment sites), but not the
  forearms. The tibial nerve at the ankle was also larger in the HNPP group,
  suggesting possible concomitant tibial neuropathy at the ankle. These results
  will help shape imaging protocols to better detect conditions with non-uniform
  nerve enlargements.
