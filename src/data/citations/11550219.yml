  Over- and under expression of the 22 kDa peripheral myelin protein (PMP22)
  results in dysmyelinating peripheral neuropathies, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth
  disease type 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy, with the liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP). Expression of the PMP22 gene is driven by two
  alternative promoters, P1 and P2, with transcripts originating from P1
  associated with peripheral nerve myelination by Schwann cells. Transient
  transfections of constructs containing P1 (3.5 kb) or P2 (2.5 kb) resulted in
  high levels of reporter gene expression in the RT4-D6P2T schwannoma cell line.
  Serial deletions of P1 revealed that region P1-A (-105 to -43), situated
  upstream of the minimal promoter, contained a positive regulatory element. The
  62 bp P1-A region conferred in cis a sevenfold increase in expression of
  luciferase driven by a heterologous promoter in an orientation-dependent
  manner. Interspecies comparison of the P1-A region revealed a 98% degree of
  identity between the human, mouse, and rat sequences. A prominent
  sequence-dependent DNA-protein complex (C-I) was detected in electrophoretic
  mobility shift assays with P1-A using RT4-D6P2T nuclear extract and was
  localized to a minimal 21 bp region within P1-A. Site-directed mutagenesis of
  this region revealed nucleotides at positions -46 to -43 as being necessary
  for formation of C-I. Functional analysis of the mutated P1-A element
  indicated that positions -46 and -45 were essential for transactivation
  mediated by this element. Characterization of the transacting factor(s)
  interacting with this key regulatory element will shed light on its role in
  regulating peripheral nerve myelination.
