abstract: >-
  Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) is the most common variety of
  neuropathy. Since the evaluation of this disorder is not standardized, the
  available literature was reviewed to provide evidence-based guidelines
  regarding the role of laboratory and genetic tests for the assessment of DSP.
  A literature review using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Current Contents was performed
  to identify the best evidence regarding the evaluation of polyneuropathy
  published between 1980 and March 2007. Articles were classified according to a
  four-tiered level of evidence scheme and recommendations were based upon the
  level of evidence. 1) Screening laboratory tests may be considered for all
  patients with polyneuropathy (Level C). Those tests that provide the highest
  yield of abnormality are blood glucose, serum B12 with metabolites
  (methylmalonic acid with or without homocysteine), and serum protein
  immunofixation electrophoresis (Level C). If there is no definite evidence of
  diabetes mellitus by routine testing of blood glucose, testing for impaired
  glucose tolerance may be considered in distal symmetric sensory polyneuropathy
  (Level C). 2) Genetic testing should be conducted for the accurate diagnosis
  and classification of hereditary neuropathies (Level A). Genetic testing may
  be considered in patients with cryptogenic polyneuropathy who exhibit a
  hereditary neuropathy phenotype (Level C). Initial genetic testing should be
  guided by the clinical phenotype, inheritance pattern, and electrodiagnostic
  features and should focus on the most common abnormalities which are CMT1A
  duplication/HNPP deletion, Cx32 (GJB1), and MFN2 mutation screening. There is
  insufficient evidence to determine the usefulness of routine genetic testing
  in patients with cryptogenic polyneuropathy who do not exhibit a hereditary
  neuropathy phenotype (Level U).
