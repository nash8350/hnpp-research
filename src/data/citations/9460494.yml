  Fluorescence in situ hybridization on methylcellulose cultured hematopoietic
  stem cells from myelodysplastic syndromes.
abstract: >-
  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal malignancies characterized by
  peripheral blood pancytopenia and signs of maturation disturbances of one or
  several cell lineages in bone marrow. MDS present as chimeras associating
  normal polyclonal and malignant monoclonal progenitors cells in various
  proportions. Numerous cytogenetic abnormalities have been reported in MDS and
  can be detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on interphase
  cells. We have used this technique on methylcellulose cultured hematopoietic
  progenitors obtained from three patients suffering from MDS and exhibiting
  informative karyotypic features. Hematopoietic cells were cultured for 14
  days, and individual clones (BFU-E, CFU-GM) were picked up and then
  cytocentrifuged for FISH analysis. We used centromeric probes realized and
  labeled in our laboratory by PCR to detect aneuploidies for chromosomes 7 and
  11 in two patients. Furthermore, we could detect a 5q partial deletion on
  interphase cells from the third patient using a 5q31 specific probe visualized
  with the HNPP Fluorescent Detection Set from Boehringer Mannheim. In
  conclusion, FISH is a helpful method to detect malignant clones in
  hematopoietic progenitor cultures and hence to study the relative growth of
  normal vs. leukemic cells in MDS.
