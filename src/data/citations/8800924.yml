  A European collaboration on Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 (CMT1) disease and
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) was
  established to estimate the duplication and deletion frequency, respectively,
  on chromosome 17p11.2 and to make an inventory of mutations in the myelin
  genes, peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22), myelin protein zero (MPZ) and
  connexin 32 (Cx32) located on chromosomes 17p11.2, 1q21-q23 and Xq13.1,
  respectively. In 70.7% of 819 unrelated CMT1 patients, the 17p11.2 duplication
  was present. In 84.0% of 156 unrelated HNPP patients, the 17p11.2 deletion was
  present. In the nonduplicated CMT1 patients, several different mutations were
  identified in the myelin genes PMP22, MPZ and Cx32.
