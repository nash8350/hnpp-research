  Although immunologic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of the
  inflammatory neuropathies, the mechanisms of recurrent episodes of
  Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS) and chronic relapsing polyneuropathies (CRP) are
  not known. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is an
  inherited disease caused by a deletion or point mutation in the peripheral
  myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene, which may manifest as a recurrent
  polyradiculoneuropathy. This study tried to elucidate the relationship between
  PMP22 and recurrent GBS and CRP. Between 1993 and 2003, we saw 114 patients
  with polyradiculoneuropathies or their variants. Only 4 patients had recurrent
  episodes 2 had recurrent GBS and 2 had CRP. We analyzed the PMP22 gene to
  determine its genetic role in these 4 patients. Genomic DNA was extracted from
  peripheral lymphocytes of all 4 patients using a previously described
  procedure, and molecular detection of PMP22 deletion was performed. The
  results showed no duplication, deletion or point mutation in the PMP22 gene.
  PMP22 gene deletion did not play a role in our patients with recurrent GBS and
  CRP.
