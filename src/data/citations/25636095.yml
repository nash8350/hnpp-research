  [Analysis of the clinical, electrophysiological and genetic features of a

  palsies].
abstract: >-
  To delineate the clinical, electrophysiological and genetics features of a
  family where 4 members were affected with hereditary neuropathy with liability
  to pressure palsies (HNPP). Clinical features of the 4 patients were
  summarized. Electrophysiological examination and genetic analysis were carried
  out. All of the patients showed recurrent motor and sensory disturbances after
  minor traction or constriction. Electrophysiology study revealed that the
  prolonged latency and reduced conduction velocity of peripheral nerve were
  general and with multiple sites of affection. The nerve locations liable to
  entrapment showed conduction block. A deletion mutation of peripheral myelin
  protein 22 (PMP22) gene was identified by genetic analysis. HNPP usually
  affects areas where nerves are liable to entrapment, and presents with motor
  and sensory disturbances of the innervated areas. Electrophysiological study
  reveals general nervous demyelination. Genetic analysis can clarify the
  diagnosis of HNPP.
