  Electrodiagnostic features of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies.
abstract: >-
  Because diagnosis of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  (HNPP) frequently is missed or delayed, we looked for electrodiagnostic
  features that raise suspicion of the disorder by making comparisons with two
  more common diseases that mimic it electrophysiologically chronic inflammatory
  demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and diabetic polyneuropathy. A
  retrospective review of the neuromuscular laboratory database was performed.
  Nine HNPP subjects, 22 with CIDP and 49 with diabetic polyneuropathy. Of all
  the HNPP nerves studied, abnormally slow sensory nerve conduction velocity
  (SNCV) was found in 93%, prolonged distal motor latencies (DML) in 78%, slow
  motor nerve conduction velocity in 31%, and prolonged F-wave latencies in 90%.
  Mean SNCV for HNPP was 85.6%+/-10.6% of the lower limit of normal and
  significantly slower than for CIDP (114.3%+/-20.1%; p<0.0001) or diabetes
  (108.1%+/-14.8%; p<0.0001). Excluding the carpal tunnel site from the analysis
  did not alter this observation Mean DML were more prolonged in HNPP, even
  without median nerve data in the analysis (118.5%+/-31.0% of the upper limit
  of normal), than in CIDP (103.2%+/-31.6%; p<0.05) or diabetes (86.3%+/-18.3%;
  p<0.0001). Mean HNPP motor nerve conduction velocity was within normal limits.
  According to findings, hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP) has a distinctive background polyneuropathy independent of
  superimposed entrapment neuropathy. It is characterized by diffuse sensory
  nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) slowing and prolongation of distal motor
  latencies with relatively infrequent and minor reduction of motor nerve
  conduction velocities. This indicates disproportionate distal conduction
  slowing in the disorder.
