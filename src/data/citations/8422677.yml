  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant disorder that causes episodes of focal demyelinating
  neuropathy following minor trauma to peripheral nerves. We assign the HNPP
  locus to chromosome 17p11.2 and demonstrate the presence of a large
  interstitial deletion associated with this disorder in three unrelated
  pedigrees. De novo deletion is documented in one pedigree. The deleted region
  appears uniform in all pedigrees and includes the gene for peripheral myelin
  protein 22 (PMP-22), suggesting that underexpression of PMP-22 may cause HNPP.
  The deletion in HNPP spans approximately 1.5 Mb and includes all markers that
  are known to map within the Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 1A (CMT1A)
  duplication. Furthermore, the breakpoints in HNPP and CMT1A map to the same
  intervals in 17p11.2, suggesting that these genetic disorders may be the
  result of reciprocal products of unequal crossover.
