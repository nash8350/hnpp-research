  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies in childhood Case
  series and literature update.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsy (HNPP) is a rare
  condition in childhood with a diverse range of clinical presentations. We
  analyzed the clinical presentation and electrophysiological data of 12
  children with a confirmed PMP22 gene deletion and reviewed the published
  reports of HNPP in children and compared our data with the reports from the
  literature review. Peroneal palsy was the most common presentation (42%)
  followed by brachial plexus palsy in 25% of our cases. Nerve conduction
  studies were always suggestive of the diagnosis demonstrating 3 major patterns
  multifocal demyelination at the area of entrapment, generalized sensory-motor
  polyneuropathy and a combination of the two first patterns in a vast majority
  (60%). Surprisingly, there was bilateral or unilateral electrophysiological
  entrapment of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel in all our patients. The
  clinical presentation of HNPP in childhood is heterogeneous and
  electrophysiological findings are helpful in establishing the diagnosis. Any
  unexplained mononeuropathy or multifocal neuropathy should lead to PMP22 gene
  testing to look for the deletion. Early diagnosis is important in order to
  facilitate appropriate genetic counseling and also for the appropriate care
  for these patients.
