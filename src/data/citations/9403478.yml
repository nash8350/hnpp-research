  Correlation between PMP-22 messenger RNA expression and phenotype in
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is associated
  with a deletion in chromosome 17p11.2, which includes the gene for the
  peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP-22). A "gene dosage" effect is probably the
  mechanism underlying HNPP, but the amount of PMP-22 mRNA in sural nerves of
  HNPP patients is highly variable and the role of PMP-22 underexpression in
  impairing myelination has yet to be clarified. We have studied 6 genetically
  proven HNPP patients, to evaluate the relationship between PMP-22 mRNA levels,
  and clinical, neurophysiological, and neuropathological findings.
  Underexpression of PMP-22 mRNA correlates with disease severity and with mean
  axon diameter and g ratio, but not with myelin thickness, number of
  "tomacula," or nerve conduction parameters. Our findings further confirm that
  underexpression of PMP-22 is the main pathogenetic mechanism underlying the
  severity of clinical symptoms and signs in HNPP. Smaller axons in sural nerves
  of HNPP patients with lower PMP-22 levels suggests that underexpression of
  PMP-22 may also affect axon development.
