  A 41-year-old man developed multifocal mononeuropathies manifesting right and
  left foot drop successively, following the left radial nerve palsy as an
  initial symptom. Based on the neurological findings and the results of the
  genetic study of peripheral myelin protein (PMP) 22 gene and the histological
  study of the sural nerve on biopsy, the diagnosis of hereditary neuropathy
  with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) was made. Two asymptomatic carriers
  were found among his family members based on the genetic study. The diagnosis
  of HNPP can be definitely established by the genetic study and this disease is
  relatively rare. In this report it is important to note that there are a few
  patients who show radial nerve palsy as an initial symptom, that we should
  carefully study the family members to obtain the prevalence of HNPP because
  asymptomatic carriers may be present, and that the carriers should be advised
  to avoid strenuous exercises and works which may produce excessive extension
  or compression of nerve trunks with the subsequent development of clinical
  symptoms.
