  We describe pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of 10 unrelated
  Italian families and seven isolated cases with hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). Our sample includes patients with
  different clinical features, varying from classical liability to pressure
  palsies to ingravescent polyneuropathy. The frequency and the uniformity in
  size of the 17p11.2 deletion was evaluated by using cosH1 probe from the
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 1A (CMT1A)-REP region. The presence of the
  deletion was demonstrated in all our patients; furthermore, the deletion was
  of identical size, although our patients had different clinical features.
  Molecular analysis of the 17p11.2 region by PFGE method proved to be a
  reliable and non-invasive method of diagnosis in HNPP cases both familial and
  isolated.
