  We applied HNPP (2-hydroxy-3-naphthoic acid-2'-phenylanilide phosphate) to
  direct in situ PCR for the routine detection of specific bacterial cells at
  the single-cell level. PCR was performed on glass slides with
  digoxigenin-labeled dUTP. The digoxigenin-labeled PCR products were detected
  with alkaline phosphatase-labeled antidigoxigenin antibody and HNPP which was
  combined with Fast Red TR. A bright red fluorescent signal was produced from
  conversion to HNP (dephosphorylated form) by alkaline phosphatase. We used the
  ECOL DNA primer set for amplification of ribosomal DNA of Escherichia coli to
  identify cells specifically at the single-cell level in a bacterial mixture.
  High-contrast images were obtained under an epifluorescence microscope with in
  situ PCR. By image analysis, E. coli cells in polluted river water also were
  detected.
