  A novel small deletion in PMP22 causes a mild hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies phenotype.
abstract: >-
  In this study we examined a family with electrophysiological findings of
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) and a mild
  clinical presentation. Four members of a family were referred for diagnosis of
  HNPP. Electrophysiological studies included motor and sensory nerve conduction
  studies in the upper and lower extremities. Investigations of microsatellites,
  using polymorphic repeat markers flanking the gene, and multiplex
  ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) were performed for molecular
  studies. The initial study of microsatellites did not detect any change, but
  MLPA demonstrated a small deletion of exon 5 in the PMP22 gene. Our findings
  demonstrate the important role of small deletions in the PMP22 gene in the
  etiology of HNPP with a normal microsatellite study.
