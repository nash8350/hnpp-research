title: Co-segregation of LMNA and PMP22 gene mutations in the same family.
abstract: >-
  We report here clinical, electrophysiological, and molecular findings in a
  family affected with two inherited genetic diseases limb girdle muscular
  dystrophy type 1B (LGMD1B) and hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP). Members of the family carry a novel missense mutation
  in the LMNA gene and a nonsense mutation in the PMP22 gene. Interestingly, the
  double LMNA/PMP22 mutations carriers showed clinical features more severe than
  usually seen in HNPP, and electrophysiological findings suggesting an axonal
  loss in addition to a typical myelinopathy. This study provides further
  insights into the relevance of lamin A/C in muscle and nerve.
