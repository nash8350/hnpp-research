  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is associated
  with a heterozygous 1.5 megabase deletion on chromosome 17 that includes the
  peripheral myelin protein (PMP) gene PMP22. We show that heterozygous PMP22
  knock-out mice, which carry only one functional pmp22 allele and thus
  genetically mimic HNPP closely, display similar morphological and
  electrophysiological features as observed in HNPP nerves. As reported
  previously, focal hypermyelinating structures called tomacula, the
  pathological hallmarks of HNPP, develop progressively in young PMP22(+/0)
  mice. By following the fate of tomacula during aging, we demonstrate now that
  these mutant animals are also interesting models for examining HNPP disease
  mechanisms. Subtle electrophysiological abnormalities are detected in
  PMP22(+/0) mice >1 year old, and a significant number of abnormally swollen
  and degenerating tomacula are present. Thinly myelinated axons and
  supernumerary Schwann cells forming onion bulbs as fingerprints of repeated
  cycles of demyelination and remyelination are also encountered frequently.
  Quantitative analyses using electron microscopy on cross sections and light
  microscopy on single teased nerve fibers suggest that tomacula are
  intrinsically unstable structures that are prone to degeneration; however, the
  severity of morphological and electrophysiological abnormalities in PMP22(+/0)
  mice is variable. These combined findings are reminiscent of the disease
  progression in HNPP and offer a possible explanation about why some HNPP
  patients develop a chronic motor and sensory neuropathy later in life that
  resembles demyelinating forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease by both
  morphological and clinical criteria.
