  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is characterised by great variability of
  genetic subtypes. This study aimed to assess the genetic subtypes of CMT
  disease in the Sardinian population. Genetic screening was performed for CMT
  cases (CMT1, CMT2, and hereditary neuropathy with susceptibility to pressure
  palsies [HNPP]). A total of 1,043 subjects (119 index cases) were evaluated.
  In CMT1 index cases (69/119; 58%), PMP22 duplication at 17p11.2 was the most
  frequent genetic diagnosis (60/69; 87%), followed by mutations in the GJB1
  gene (5/69; 7.2%), in the SH3TC2 gene (3/69; 4.4%) and PMP22 Gly107Val point
  mutation (1/69; 1.4%). The CMT2 group (24/119; 20.1%) comprised 10/24 (41.6%)
  patients carrying MPZ gene Ser44Phe mutation, 6/24 (25%) with mutations in
  MFN2 and HSPB1, and 1/24 (4.2%) in GJB1 and LRSAM1. In the HNPP group (26/119;
  21.9%), the majority of patients reported the PMP22 deletion (25/26; 96.2%).
  Further studies are needed to comprehend the overall picture of the disease in
  Mediterranean area.
