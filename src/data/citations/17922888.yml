  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies description of seven
  patients without known family history.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  inherited disorder resulting in a polyneuropathy with particular involvement
  at sites of entrapment, and is often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. We report
  findings on seven patients referred for evaluation of focal mononeuropathies
  or polyneuropathies of undetermined etiology, in whom we established a
  diagnosis of HNPP. We retrospectively reviewed clinical, electrophysiological
  and laboratory data for patients diagnosed with HNPP over a 4-year period at
  our institution. All patients had transient or recurrent neurological
  symptoms, some with residual deficits. No patients had a family history of any
  neuropathy. Electrodiagnostic studies revealed abnormal conduction findings at
  symptomatic and asymptomatic sites. Testing for the Peripheral Myelin Protein
  (PMP22) deletion was positive in all patients. A high index of clinical
  suspicion and thorough electrodiagnostic evaluation can lead to correct
  diagnosis of HNPP, despite the absence of a positive family history.
