  Overlap phenotype between CMT1A and hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies caused by the novel small in-frame deletion c.407_418del12 in
  PMP22 gene.
abstract: >-
  We report monozygotic twins, who presented with a clinical picture of
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1) with bilateral foot drop, pes cavus,
  thoracic kyphosis, and scoliosis. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP) showed up in one of them. Neurography showed
  demyelinating neuropathy, typical for CMT1, and transient conduction block in
  the ulnar nerve correlating with clinical ulnar palsy due to minor mechanical
  stress in only one of them. Genetic analysis revealed novel small de novo
  deletion c.407_418del12 in the PMP22 gene. Our patient shows the rarely
  reported combination of CMT1A and HNPP, caused by an in-frame deletion in the
  PMP22 gene. HNPP is in the majority of cases correlated with heterozygous
  deletion of the whole PMP22 gene or other mutations leading to functional
  haploinsufficiency. The cases give further evidence that pathogenesis of HNPP
  is not completely understood and can obviously result from existence of a
  defective protein, too. The intrafamiliar phenotypic variability, even in
  monozygotic twins, confirms the well-known fact that factors apart from
  genetics contribute to the clinical course.
