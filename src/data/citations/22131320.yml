  Mutation analysis of PMP22 in Slovak patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
  and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.
abstract: >-
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and related peripheral neuropathies are the
  most commonly inherited neurological disorders in humans, characterized by
  clinical and genetic heterogeneity. The most prevalent clinical entities
  belonging to this group of disorders are CMT type 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). CMT1A and HNPP are
  predominantly caused by a 1.5 Mb duplication and deletion in the chromosomal
  region 17p11.2, respectively, and less frequently by other mutations in the
  peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. Despite being relatively common
  diseases, they haven't been previously studied in the Slovak population.
  Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the spectrum and frequency of
  PMP22 mutations in the Slovak population by screening 119 families with CMT
  and 2 families with HNPP for causative mutations in this gene. The copy number
  determination of PMP22 resulted in the detection of CMT1A duplication in 40
  families and the detection of HNPP deletion in 7 families, 6 of which were
  originally diagnosed as CMT. Consequent mutation screening of families without
  duplication or deletion using dHPLC and sequencing identified 6 single base
  changes (3 unpublished to date), from which only c.327C>A (Cys109X) present in
  one family was provably causative. These results confirm the leading role of
  PMP22 mutation analysis in the differential diagnosis of CMT and show that the
  spectrum and frequency of PMP22 mutations in the Slovak population is
  comparable to that seen in the global population.
