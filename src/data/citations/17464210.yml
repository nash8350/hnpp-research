  Rapid diagnosis of CMT1A duplications and HNPP deletions by multiplex
  microsatellite PCR.
abstract: >-
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease and hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP) are frequent forms of genetically heterogeneous
  peripheral neuropathies. Reciprocal unequal crossover between flanking
  CMT1A-REPs on chromosome 17p11.2-p12 is a major cause of CMT type 1A (CMT1A)
  and HNPP. The importance of a sensitive and rapid method for identifying the
  CMT1A duplication and HNPP deletion is being emphasized. In the present study,
  we established a molecular diagnostic method for the CMT1A duplication and
  HNPP deletion based on hexaplex PCR of 6 microsatellite markers (D17S921,
  D17S9B, D17S9A, D17S918, D17S4A and D17S2230). The method is highly time-,
  cost- and sample-saving because the six markers are amplified by a single PCR
  reaction and resolved with a single capillary in 3 h. Several statistical and
  forensic estimates indicated that most of these markers are likely to be
  useful for diagnosing the peripheral neuropathies. Reproducibility, as
  determined by concordance between independent tests, was estimated to be 100%.
  The likelihood that genotypes of all six markers are homozygous in randomly
  selected individuals was calculated to be 1.6 x 10(-4) which indicates that
  the statistical error rate for this diagnosis of HNPP deletion is only 0.016%.
