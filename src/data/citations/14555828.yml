  Rapid detection of duplication/deletion of the PMP22 gene in patients with
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Type 1A and hereditary neuropathy with liability
  to pressure palsy by real-time quantitative PCR using SYBR Green I dye.
abstract: >-
  Mutations and altered gene dosage of the peripheral myelin protein (PMP22)
  gene in chromosome 17p11.2-12 are the main causes for hereditary neuropathies,
  accounting for approximately 70% of all cases. Patients with duplication of
  the PMP22 develop Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and deletion of
  one PMP22 allele leads to hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsy (HNPP). Twenty patients with CMT1A, 17 patients with HNPP, and 18 normal
  family members and 28 normal controls were studied by real-time quantitative
  PCR using SYBR Green I on the ABI 7700 Sequence Detection System. The copy
  number of the PMP22 gene was determined by the comparative threshold cycle
  method and the albumin was used as a reference gene. The PMP22 duplication
  ratio ranged from 1.45 to 2.06 and the PMP22 deletion ratio ranged from 0.42
  to 0.64. The PMP22 ratio in normal controls, including normal family members,
  ranged from 0.85 to 1.26. No overlap was found between patients with CMT1A or
  patients with HNPP and normal controls. This method is fast, highly sensitive,
  specific, and reproducible in detecting PMP22 duplication and deletion in
  CMT1A and HNPP patients, respectively.
