  Human nerve pathology caused by different mutational mechanisms of the PMP22
  gene.
abstract: >-
  The study of the morphological phenotypes in patients with different mutations
  of the PMP22 gene gives additional insights into the role of the protein in
  myelin function. The pathology in young patients is in some aspects different
  from the pathology in older patients, providing essential and additional
  information about the early disease processes in humans induced by different
  PMP22 mutational mechanisms. Duplication of chromosome 17p11.2, causing an
  overexpression of the PMP22 gene, results in early hypermyelination. This
  suggests that PMP22 has a function in establishing the proper myelin
  thickness, probably in response to an axonal signal. Demyelination and
  remyelination with gradual formation of onion bulbs occur apparently as
  secondary processes, but these processes subside at the end of the first
  decade. PMP22 missense mutations usually result in a more severe phenotype
  showing an early hypomyelination and onion bulb formation, likely disturbing
  normal myelin formation and maintenance. The morphological differences with
  duplication cases underline the essential difference in pathogenesis between
  duplication and missense mutations despite the large overlap in clinical and
  electrophysiological phenotypes. The reciprocal deletion of chromosome
  17p11.2, resulting in an underexpression of the PMP22 gene, is responsible for
  the clinical phenotype of HNPP. As the nerve abnormalities in HNPP show a
  marked resemblance to the changes in experimental and genuine human entrapment
  neuropathies, it is postulated that PMP22 has a function in adhesion of myelin
  lamellae, preventing mutual longitudinal sliding. Deletion of one PMP22 copy
  results in increased susceptibility for mechanical forces through which
  already minor nerve injuries might induce a longitudinal displacement of
  myelin lamellae. The frame shift mutation Gly94(insG) combines a loss of
  function like in the common deletion HNPP with a mild CMT1 phenotype, likely
  inducing a (mild) toxic gain of function by disturbing myelin formation and
  maintenance, comparable to the effect in missense mutations.
