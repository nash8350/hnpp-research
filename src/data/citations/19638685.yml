  Within the last decade, numerous methods have been applied to detect the most
  common mutation in patients affected with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease,
  i.e. submicroscopic duplication in the 17p11.2--p12 region. In 1993, another
  neuropathy - known as hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  (HNPP) - has been shown to be caused by a 17p11.2--p12 deletion. Historically,
  Southern blot analysis was the first approach to identify CMT1A duplication or
  HNPP deletion. This time- and labor-consuming method requires prior selection
  of DNA samples. In fact, only CMT patients affected with the demyelinating
  form of CMT1 have been screened for CMT1A duplication. After the 17p11.2--p12
  duplication was identified in the CMT1 families, subsequent studies revealed
  additional axonal features in the patients harboring the 17p11.2--p12
  duplication. Thus it seems reasonable to test all patients affected with CMT
  for the presence of the 17p11.2--p12 duplication. To evaluate the utility of
  real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and restriction fragment length
  polymorphism PCR (RFLP-PCR), we screened a large group of 179 families with
  the diagnosis of CMT/HNPP for the presence of the 17p11.2--p12
  duplication/deletion. Due to a high frequency of CMT1A duplication in familial
  cases of CMT, we propose (in contrast to the previous studies) to perform
  Q-PCR analysis in all patients diagnosed with CMT.
