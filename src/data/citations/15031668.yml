  Korean ancestry with chromosome 17p11.2-p12 deletion.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by recurrent pressure
  palsies. Most HNPP patients have a 1.5 mb deletion in chromosome 17p11.2-p12.
  The present study aimed at evaluating the deletion of the 17p11.2-p12 region
  in Korean subjects with families exhibiting HNPP phenotype, and to determine
  the clinical, electrophysiological and morphological aspects specifically
  associated with this deletion in HNPP patients. By genotyping six
  microsatellite markers (D17S921, D17S955, D17S1358, D17S839, D17S122 and
  D17S261), HNPP with the deletion was observed in 79% (19 of 24) of HNPP
  families. Nerve conduction studies were performed in 35 HNPP patients from
  these 19 families. The observed HNPP deletion frequency in Koreans is
  consistent with findings in other populations. Disease onset occurred at a
  significantly earlier age in patients with recurrent pressure palsies than in
  those with a single attack (P < 0.01). Nerve conduction studies demonstrated
  diffuse mild to moderate slowing of nerve conduction velocities that were
  worse over the common entrapment sites, regardless of the clinical
  manifestations. A long duration of compound muscle action potentials without a
  conduction block or a temporal dispersion is a characteristic of this disease.
  A sural nerve biopsy with teasing was performed in four patients, and tomacula
  of the myelin sheath was found in 56.4%. Our findings appear to support the
  existence of a phenotype/genotype correlation in HNPP patients of Korean
  ancestry with the deletion, and suggest that HNPP patients with earlier
  symptom onset face an increased chance of having recurrent attacks.
