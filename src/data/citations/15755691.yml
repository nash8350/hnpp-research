  Point mutations affecting PMP22 can cause hereditary demyelinating and
  dysmyelinating peripheral neuropathies. In addition, duplication and deletion
  of PMP22 are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Type 1A (CMT1A) and
  Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsy (HNPP), respectively.
  This study was designed to elucidate disease processes caused by misexpression
  of Pmp22 and, at the same time, to gain further information on the
  controversial molecular function of PMP22. To this end, we took advantage of
  the unique resource of a set of various Pmp22 mutant mice to carry out
  comparative expression profiling of mutant and wild-type sciatic nerves.
  Tissues derived from Pmp22-/- ("knockout"), Pmp22tg (increased Pmp22 copy
  number), and Trembler (Tr; point mutation in Pmp22) mutant mice were analyzed
  at two developmental stages (i) at postnatal day (P)4, when normal myelination
  has just started and primary causative defects of the mutations are expected
  to be apparent, and (ii) at P60, with the goal of obtaining information on
  secondary disease effects. Interestingly, the three Pmp22 mutants exhibited
  distinct profiles of gene expression, suggesting different disease mechanisms.
  Increased expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA
  replication is characteristic and specific for the early stage in Pmp22-/-
  mice, supporting a primary function of PMP22 in the regulation of Schwann cell
  proliferation. In the Tr mutant, a distinguishing feature is the high
  expression of stress response genes. Both Tr and Pmp22tg mice show strongly
  reduced expression of genes important for cholesterol synthesis at P4, a
  characteristic that is common to all three mutants at P60. Finally, we have
  identified a number of candidate genes that may play important roles in the
  disease process or in myelination per se.
