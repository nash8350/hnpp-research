  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (NHPP) is an
  autosomal dominant disease of peripheral nerves, characterized by recurrent
  focal neuropathies often with an underlying asymptomatic polyneuropathy. We
  report the clinical, electrophysiological, and histopathological findings in
  three families with HNPP and confirm the presence of a deletion on chromosome
  17p11.2, including all the markers known to be duplicated in
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A. This deletion appears to be the
  underlying molecular deficit in this disease and provides additional evidence
  for the importance of this locus for peripheral nerve function.
