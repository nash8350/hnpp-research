  [Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies in childhood Report
  of three cases].
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is an autosomal
  dominant neuropathy. It is characterized by recurrent sensory and motor nerve
  palsies, usually precipitated by minor trauma or compression. Even though rare
  in childhood, this disorder is probably underdiagnosed given its wide spectrum
  of clinical symptoms. We review three separate cases of HNPP diagnosed in
  children with various phenotypes fluctuating and distal paresthesias
  disrupting learning at school, cramps related to intensive piano practice, and
  discrete muscle weakness with no functional complaint. Family history should
  be carefully reviewed to identify potential undiagnosed HNPP cases, as in our
  three reports. Electrophysiological study is essential for the diagnosis, with
  a double advantage to confirm the presence of focal abnormalities in
  clinically symptomatic areas and to guide molecular biology by revealing an
  underlying demyelinating polyneuropathy. The diagnosis of HNPP is confirmed by
  genetic testing, which in 90% of cases shows a 1.5-Mb deletion of chromosome
  17p11.2 including the PMP22 gene. Patients are expected to make a full
  recovery after each relapse. However, it is very important for both the
  patient and his or her family to establish a diagnosis in order to prevent
  recurrent palsy brought on by situations involving prolonged immobilizations
  leading to nerve compression.
