abstract: >-
  Delayed lesions of the femoral or sciatic nerve are a rare complication after
  total hip arthroplasty. Several cases in association with cement edges, scar
  tissue, broken cerclages, deep hematoma, or reinforcement rings have been
  published. We report about a 62-year-old female who developed a pure motor
  paresis of the quadriceps muscle 2 weeks after total hip arthroplasty. After
  electrophysiological evaluation had revealed an isolated femoral nerve lesion,
  revision of the femoral nerve was performed. During operative revision no
  pathologic findings could be seen. One week later the patient developed
  paralysis of the left wrist and finger extensors after using crutches.
  Electrophysiological evaluation revealed several nerve conduction blocks in
  physiological entrapments and the diagnosis of hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) was established. Hereditary neuropathy
  with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is a rare disease with increased
  vulnerability of the peripheral nerve system with mostly reversible
  sensorimotor deficits. It should be taken into consideration in cases of
  atypical findings of compression syndromes of peripheral nerves or delayed
  neuropathy, e. g., after total hip arthroplasty.
