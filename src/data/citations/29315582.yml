  A dual role for Integrin α6β4 in modulating hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies.
abstract: >-
  Peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) is a component of compact myelin in the
  peripheral nervous system. The amount of PMP22 in myelin is tightly regulated,
  and PMP22 over or under-expression cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1A (CMT1A) and
  Hereditary Neuropathy with Pressure Palsies (HNPP). Despite the importance of
  PMP22, its function remains largely unknown. It was reported that PMP22
  interacts with the β4 subunit of the laminin receptor α6β4 integrin,
  suggesting that α6β4 integrin and laminins may contribute to the pathogenesis
  of CMT1A or HNPP. Here we asked if the lack of α6β4 integrin in Schwann cells
  influences myelin stability in the HNPP mouse model. Our data indicate that
  PMP22 and β4 integrin may not interact directly in myelinating Schwann cells,
  however, ablating β4 integrin delays the formation of tomacula, a
  characteristic feature of HNPP. In contrast, ablation of integrin β4 worsens
  nerve conduction velocities and non-compact myelin organization in HNPP
  animals. This study demonstrates that indirect interactions between an
  extracellular matrix receptor and a myelin protein influence the stability and
  function of myelinated fibers.
