abstract: >-
  Point mutations in the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene rarely cause
  the hereditary neuropathies Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), both of which
  show a demyelinating phenotype. In this study we characterized a family with
  an axonal neuropathy. Three family members carried a heterozygous point
  mutation of the PMP22 gene, resulting in amino acid substitution R159C.
  Screening of 185 healthy controls did not reveal the R159C allele in any case.
  The novel R159C mutation represents a very rare case of a dominant PMP22
  mutation causing an axonal neuropathy.
