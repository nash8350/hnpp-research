  Hereditary demyelinating peripheral neuropathies consist of a heterogeneous
  group of genetic disorders that includes hereditary neuropathy with liability
  to pressure palsies (HNPP), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), Dejerine-Sottas
  syndrome (DSS), and congenital hypomyelination (CH). The clinical
  classification of these neuropathies into discrete categories can sometimes be
  difficult because there can be both clinical and pathologic variation and
  overlap between these disorders. We have identified five novel mutations in
  the myelin protein zero (MPZ) gene, encoding the major structural protein (P0)
  of peripheral nerve myelin, in patients with either CMT1B, DSS, or CH. This
  finding suggests that these disorders may not be distinct pathophysiologic
  entities, but rather represent a spectrum of related "myelinopathies" due to
  an underlying defect in myelination. Furthermore, we hypothesize the
  differences in clinical severity seen with mutations in MPZ are related to the
  type of mutation and its subsequent effect on protein function (i.e., loss of
  function versus dominant negative).
