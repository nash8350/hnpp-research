  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) is a common autosomal dominant
  demyelinating neuropathy that is associated with a 1.5 megabase (Mb) tandem
  DNA duplication in chromosome 17p11.2-p12. Hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP, tomaculous neuropathy) is another less
  frequently diagnosed autosomal dominant neuropathy and is associated with a
  1.5 Mb deletion in chromosome 17p11.2-12. Meiotic unequal crossover is a
  proposed mechanism for the generation of both the duplication in CMT1A and the
  deletion in HNPP. CMT1A-REP is a repeat that flanks the region which is
  duplicated/deleted in CMT1A/HNPP. The CMT1A-REP repeat sequence may mediate
  unequal crossover through misalignment of the homologous, repeated sequences.
  Three copies of the CMT1A-REP repeat are present on stably inherited CMT1A
  duplication chromosomes. In this report, molecular analysis in multiple
  patients detected three copies of the CMT1A-REP sequence on both inherited and
  de novo CMT1A duplication chromosomes, and one copy of the CMT1A-REP repeat on
  the deleted chromosome in both inherited and de novo HNPP. These observations
  support the hypothesis that a reciprocal recombination mechanism involving the
  CMT1A-REP is responsible for the generation of both the duplicated and deleted
  chromosomes, and document the first examples in humans of Mendelian syndromes
  resulting from the reciprocal products of unequal exchange involving large
  intra-chromosomal segments.
