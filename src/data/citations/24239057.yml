  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is a disorder
  mainly caused by a 1.5-Mb deletion at 17p11.2-12 (and in some rare cases by
  point mutations) and clinically associated with recurrent painless palsies.
  Here, we performed electrophysiological (motor, sensory and terminal latency
  index), MRI and genetic studies in a family referred for ulnar neuropathy with
  pain. Surprisingly, we found typical neurophysiological features of HNPP
  (prolongation of distal motor latencies and diffuse SNCV slowing with
  significant slowing of motor nerve conduction velocities). Besides, the
  proband presented conduction block in left ulnar, left median and both
  peroneal nerves. MRI findings were consistent with an underlying neuropathy.
  Molecular studies identified a novel frameshift mutation in PMP22 confirming
  the diagnosis of HNPP. Our data suggest that neurophysiological studies are
  essential to characterize underdiagnosed HNPP patients referred for peripheral
  neuropathy. Our experience shows that MRI could be a complementary tool for
  the diagnosis of these patients.
