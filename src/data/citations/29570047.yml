  Painless motor radiculopathy of the cervical spine clinical and radiological
  characteristics and long-term outcomes after operative decompression.
abstract: >-
  OBJECTIVE Various neurological diseases are known to cause progressive
  painless paresis of the upper limbs. In this study the authors describe the
  previously unspecified syndrome of compression-induced painless cervical
  radiculopathy with predominant motor deficit and muscular atrophy, and
  highlight the clinical and radiological characteristics and outcomes after
  surgery for this rare syndrome, along with its neurological differential
  diagnoses. METHODS Medical records of 788 patients undergoing surgical
  decompression due to degenerative cervical spine diseases between 2005 and
  2014 were assessed. Among those patients, 31 (3.9%, male to female ratio 4.8
  to 1, mean age 60 years) presented with painless compressive cervical motor
  radiculopathy due to neuroforaminal stenosis without signs of myelopathy;
  long-term evaluation was available in 23 patients with 49 symptomatic
  foraminal stenoses. Clinical, imaging, and operative findings as well as the
  long-term course of paresis and quality of life were analyzed. RESULTS
  Presenting symptoms (mean duration 13.3 months) included a defining
  progressive flaccid radicular paresis (median grade 3/5) without any history
  of radiating pain (100%) and a concomitant muscular atrophy (78%); 83% of the
  patients were smokers and 17% patients had diabetes. Imaging revealed a
  predominantly anterior nerve root compression at the neuroforaminal entrance
  in 98% of stenoses. Thirty stenoses (11 patients) were initially decompressed
  via an anterior surgical approach and 19 stenoses (12 patients) via a
  posterior surgical approach. Overall reoperation rate due to new or recurrent
  stenoses was 22%, with time to reoperation shorter in smokers (p = 0.033).
  Independently of the surgical procedure chosen, long-term follow-up (mean 3.9
  years) revealed a stable or improved paresis in 87% of the patients (median
  grade 4/5) and an excellent general performance and quality of life.
  CONCLUSIONS Painless cervical motor radiculopathy predominantly occurs due to
  focal compression of the anterior nerve root at the neuroforaminal entrance.
  Surgical decompression is effective in stabilizing or improving motor function
  with a resulting favorable long-term outcome.
