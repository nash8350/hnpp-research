  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant disease that causes episodes of recurrent mononeuropathies
  following minor trauma or pressure. It was recently reported that deletion of
  the peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP-22) gene was associated with HNPP in
  three unrelated American pedigrees and one Dutch pedigree, but not in another
  Dutch pedigree. We tested a Japanese family with HNPP for PMP-22 gene
  deletion. HNPP diagnosis was established by a history of recurrent
  mononeuropathies following moderate compression, delayed distal latencies and
  F-wave latencies, and the characteristic focal thickening of the myelin sheath
  ("tomacula") in sural nerves. Genomic DNA of the HNPP patients was extracted
  from peripheral blood lymphocytes. The DNA was cut by the restriction
  endonuclease BamHI, separated by electrophoresis and the fragments hybridized
  with probes for PMP-22 cDNA and human muscle specific phosphoglycerate mutase
  (PGAM) cDNA (used as internal control). The intensity of the autoradiographs
  of patients was measured densitometrically and compared to that of normal
  controls. Our analysis revealed that the PMP-22 and PGAM autoradiograph
  intensity ratio in the specimens of the HNPP patients was 60% of that of
  control individuals, thus suggesting that the patients only had a single copy
  of the PMP-22 gene. From these data we conclude that the PMP-22 gene also was
  deleted in the Japanese family with HNPP.
