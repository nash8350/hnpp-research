  Spinobulbar muscular atrophy combined with atypical hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsy.
abstract: >-
  Spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked recessive disease,
  presenting motor weakness and wasting of facial, bulbar and limb muscles.
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is autosomal
  dominant disorder characterized by recurrent neuropathies at common entrapment
  sites. We report a case of co-existence of SBMA and atypical HNPP with genetic
  confirmation of CAG expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene and deletion
  of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. A 62-year-old man presented
  with progressive muscle weakness, fasciculations in upper and lower limbs and
  dysesthesia predominantly in the distal regions. No family members, including
  his children, experienced similar symptoms. The electrodiagnostic examination
  was compatible with demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Simultaneous
  hereditary polyneuropathy and motor neuron disease were suspected and relevant
  genetic testing was confirmed HNPP and SBMA. This case presented with 2 rare
  genetic neuromuscular disorders and the atypical HNPP phenotype. This case
  highlight the importance of detailed patient histories, as well as
  neurological and electrophysiological examinations for diagnosis of atypical
  and combination of rare genetic disorders.
