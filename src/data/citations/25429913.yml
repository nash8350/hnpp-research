  The objective of this study is to assess the genetic distribution of
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease in Campania, a region of Southern Italy. We
  analyzed a cohort of 197 index cases and reported the type and frequency of
  mutations for the whole CMT population and for each electrophysiological group
  (CMT1, CMT2, and hereditary neuropathy with susceptibility to pressure palsies
  [HNPP]) and for familial and isolated CMT cases. Genetic diagnosis was
  achieved in 148 patients (75.1%) with a higher success rate in HNPP and CMT1
  than CMT2. Only four genes (PMP22, GJB1, MPZ, and GDAP1) accounted for 92% of
  all genetically confirmed CMT cases. In CMT1, PMP22 duplication was the most
  common mutation while the second gene in order of frequency was MPZ in
  familial and SH3TC2 in isolated cases. In CMT2, GJB1 was the most frequent
  mutated gene and GJB1 with GDAP1 accounted for almost 3/4 of genetically
  defined CMT2 patients. The first gene in order of frequency was GJB1 in
  familial and GDAP1 in isolated cases. In HNPP, the majority of patients
  harbored the PMP22 gene deletion. The novelty of our data is the relatively
  high frequency of SH3TC2 and GDAP1 mutations in demyelinating and axonal
  forms, respectively. These epidemiological data can help in panel design for
  our patients' population.
