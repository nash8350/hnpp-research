  In the majority of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) patients, the
  peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP-22) gene maps within 1.5 megabase
  duplication on chromosome 17p11.2-12. The PMP-22 gene dosage is believed to be
  a major determining factor in the molecular pathology of CMT1A. Median nerve
  conduction velocities were below 35 m/sec in 17 CMT1A patients examined.
  Northern blot analysis showed that the mean relative ratio of PMP-22 mRNA
  levels in biopsied nerves of 5 patients with CMT1A is significantly higher
  than that in disease controls. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that
  Schwann cell cytoplasm including onion bulbs as well as the myelin sheath was
  positive for PMP-22 in some patients with CMT1A, while PMP-22 was expressed
  only on compact portion of the myelin sheath in non-CMT1A patients and normal
  subjects. A minority of CMT1A are known to carry dominant and recessive point
  mutations in PMP-22. Some patients with Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS) also
  have dominant and recessive point mutations in PMP-22. Instead of being two
  completely distinct disease entities, DSS and CMT1A form a spectrum of
  inherited PMP-22 related neuropathies, including hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies which carries a deletion of the PMP-22 gene.
