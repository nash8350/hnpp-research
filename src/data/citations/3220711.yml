  Two families with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  (HNPP) were evaluated clinically, electrophysiologically and pathologically (2
  index cases). Familial patterns suggest autosomal dominant inheritance. The
  clinical presentation is characteristic, with recurrent painless transitory
  mononeuropathy, without evident triggering factors, or caused by trivial
  trauma or pressure. In affected members neurophysiological studies showed
  diffuse slowing in nerve conduction, more evident at common sites of
  entrapment. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) showed bilateral peripheral
  abnormalities with proximal nerve involvement more pronounced in older
  patients. 40 to 75% of teased fibers displayed sausage-shaped swellings.
  Ultrastructurally some sausages showed redundant myelin loops and excessive
  number of myelin lamellae that seem to cause axonal constriction.
