  This study evaluates carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) symptom severity, functional
  status, and outcome of CTS therapies in patients with inherited neuropathies.
  Validated questionnaires were used to compare symptom severity and functional
  status in patients with and without a diagnosis of CTS and a diagnosis of an
  inherited neuropathy. 309 patients with inherited neuropathies participated in
  this study. The CTS symptom severity score (SSS) was found to be the most
  useful tool in assessing CTS severity in patients with inherited neuropathy.
  Splint therapy and surgery were associated with significant improvement in
  carpal tunnel symptoms as measured through the SSS. This study provides
  insight into the assessment of CTS symptom severity and patient-reported
  outcomes to CTS therapy in individuals with inherited neuropathies. The SSS
  appears useful for evaluation of CTS symptoms and patient-reported outcomes
  following CTS interventions in individuals with inherited neuropathies. Muscle
