  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant, demyelinating neuropathy. Point mutations in the PMP22
  gene are a rare cause of HNPP. A novel PMP22 splice site mutation (c.179+1
  G-->C) is reported in an HNPP family. By reverse transcriptase-polymerase
  chain reaction experiments, this mutation was shown to cause the synthesis of
  an abnormal mRNA in which a premature stop codon probably produces a truncated
  non-functional protein.
