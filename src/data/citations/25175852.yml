  A brachial plexus lesion is not common in hereditary neuropathy with liability
  to pressure palsy (HNPP). We report the clinical and electrodiagnostic
  features of young soldiers with HNPP presenting with brachial plexopathy. By
  reviewing 2year medical records from Korean military hospitals, we identified
  soldiers with brachial plexus lesions. Among them, patients diagnosed with
  HNPP were determined and clinical and electrophysiological findings were
  compared between HNPP and non-HNPP patients with a brachial plexus lesion.
  Thirteen patients (6.8%) were diagnosed with HNPP among 189 patients with a
  brachial plexus lesion. Push-ups, as either a punishment or an exercise, was
  the most frequent preceding event in HNPP patients (76.9%), whereas it was
  rare in non-HNPP patients. The distal motor latency of the median nerve showed
  the highest sensitivity (90.9%) and specificity (100%) for HNPP in patients
  with a brachial plexus lesion. In conclusion, HNPP should be suspected in
  patients with brachial plexopathy if brachial plexopathy develops after
  push-ups or if the distal motor latency of median nerves is prolonged.
