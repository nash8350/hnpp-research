  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant disorder most commonly caused by a 1.5-Mb deletion in
  chromosome 17p11.2 which contains the peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22)
  gene. Mutations resulting in functional loss of one PMP22 gene copy are less
  frequent. We present a 51-year-old patient with a l.5-Mb deletion in
  chromosome 17p11.2 who exhibited signs of peripheral as well as central
  nervous system lesions. He gave a history of recurrent episodes of limb
  numbness and weakness with spontaneous but incomplete recovery since age 20.
  His father and two brothers had similar symptoms. Neurological examination
  revealed signs of multiple mononeuropathy associated with frontal lobe,
  corticospinal tract and cerebellar dysfunction, as well as signs of initial
  cognitive impairment. Electrophysiological investigations showed a
  demyelinating peripheral nerve disease with multiple conduction blocks and
  conduction disturbances in both optic nerves. Magnetic resonance imaging of
  the brain revealed multiple subcortical and periventricular foci of myelin
  lesions. The association of central and peripheral nervous system lesions in
  this patient indicates a possible role of PMP22 not only in peripheral but
  also in central nervous system myelin structure.
