abstract: >-
  We report a patient who had episodes of recurrent peripheral nerve pressure
  palsies. Electrodiagnostically, we found a clear decrease of nerve conduction
  velocity in affected and unaffected nerves. All the patient's relatives showed
  entirely normal clinical and electrodiagnostic findings. Histopathologically,
  there were extensive irregularities of the myelin sheaths with numerous
  tomaculous swellings. DNA analysis revealed a deletion for probes flanking the
  PMP-22 gene at the maternal chromosome 17 in our patient. His mother showed a
  normal gene dosage for all markers deleted in our patient, indicating a new
  mutation.
