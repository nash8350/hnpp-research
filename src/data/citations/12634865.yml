  A 1.4-Mb tandem duplication, including the gene for peripheral myelin protein
  22 (PMP22) in chromosome 17p11.2-12 is responsible for 70% of the cases of the
  demyelinating type 1 of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease or hereditary motor and
  sensory neuropathy I (CMT1A/HMSN I). A reciprocal deletion of this CMT1A
  region causes the hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  (HNPP). The CMT1A duplication increases the PMP22 gene dosage from two to
  three, the HNPP deletion reduces the gene dosage from two to one. Currently,
  routine diagnosis of HMSN/HNPP patients is mainly performed with polymorphic
  markers in-between the repetitive elements flanking the CMT1A region. These
  show quantitative and/or qualitative changes in case of a CMT1A duplication
  and a homozygous allele pattern in case of HNPP deletion. In HNPP patients the
  deletion is usually confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). We
  now developed a reliable, single tube real-time quantitative PCR assay for
  rapid determination of PMP22 gene dosage directly. This method involves a
  multiplex reaction using FAM labelled Taqman-probe with TAMRA quencher derived
  from PMP22 exon 3 and a VIC labelled probe with non-fluorescent quencher from
  exon 12 of the albumin gene as internal reference. Copy number of the PMP22
  gene was determined by the comparative threshold cycle method (deltadeltaCt).
  Each sample was run in quadruplicate and analysed at two different threshold
  levels. The level giving the smallest standard deviation was scored. We
  evaluated this method through the retrospective analysis of 252 HMSN patients
  with known genotype and could confirm the previous findings in 99% of cases.
  Two patients were wrongly diagnosed with microsatellite analysis while
  quantitative real-time PCR identified the correct genotype, as confirmed by
  FISH. Thus, this method shows superior sensitivity to microsatellite analysis
  and has the additional advantage of being a fast and uniform assay for
  quantitative analysis of both CMT1A and HNPP.
