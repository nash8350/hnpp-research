  A 43-year-old female with carcinoma of the left breast underwent wide local
  excision of the tumour and sentinel lymph node biopsy under general
  anaesthesia. Three lymph nodes were removed uneventfully during the operation.
  Postoperatively, the patient complained of weakness and decreased sensation of
  her left arm. A diagnosis of peri-operative neuropraxia was made. This
  resolved completely over the following 4 weeks. Genetic testing confirmed a
  diagnosis of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.
