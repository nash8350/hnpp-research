  [Hereditary neuropathy with tendency to pressure palsies (HNPP) in a child
  clinical and biological diagnosis. A case report].
abstract: >-
  HNPP occurs rarely but not exceptionally during childhood. José M., seven
  years old, presented an isolated radial nerve palsy of progressive onset with
  no other clinical feature. There was no family history of neurological
  disorder. The electromyogram (EMG) showed a 'mosaic-like' pattern of extended
  sensitive and motor alterations, with diminished conduction velocities and
  amplitudes and increased distal latencies. HNPP was considered through the
  association of an isolated radial nerve palsy with an asymptomatic
  polyneuropathy, and was confirmed by molecular biology. HNPP is generally
  considered on clinical features, heredity and EMG findings. Molecular biology
  confirms the diagnosis in most of the cases, even in apparently sporadic
  patients, and is of great interest in atypical cases.
