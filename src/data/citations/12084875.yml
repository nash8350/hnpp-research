  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy the electrophysiology

abstract: >-
  Studies of patients with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP) have shown accentuated distal slowing along with nonuniform
  conduction abnormalities at segments liable to compression, suggesting a
  distal myelinopathy as an underlying pathophysiological mechanism. We
  evaluated 12 patients with HNPP by standard nerve conduction studies and by
  conduction to more proximal muscles in the arm and leg. Three CMT1A patients
  and six healthy subjects also were evaluated as controls. Median and peroneal
  motor nerves in all HNPP patients showed prolonged distal motor latencies
  (DML) (mean +/- SE, 5.9 +/- 0.41 and 8.63 +/- 0.58 milliseconds), but the
  ulnar and tibial DML were minimally prolonged or normal (mean +/- SE, 3.87 +/-
  0.16 and 5.66 +/- 0.24 milliseconds). DML to forearm flexor (median and ulnar
  nerves) or anterior tibial muscles (peroneal nerve) were also normal.
  Accentuated distal slowing is found primarily in median and peroneal nerve
  segments liable to pressure palsies or repetitive trauma. However, the ulnar
  and tibial nerves, which are less liable to compression, have minimal changes.
  In addition, distal latencies to more proximal muscles in the arm and leg do
  not have distal slowing. These findings do not support a distal myelinopathy
  as a determinant of the conduction abnormalities in HNPP.
