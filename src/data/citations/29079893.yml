  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) has historically
  been considered a pain-free condition, though some people with HNPP also
  complain of pain. This study characterised persistent pain in people with
  HNPP. Participants provided cross-sectional demographic data, information on
  the presence of neurological and persistent pain symptoms, and the degree to
  which these interfered with daily life. The painDETECT and Central
  Sensitization Inventory questionnaires were used to indicate potential
  neuropathic, central sensitisation and musculoskeletal (nociceptive) pain
  mechanisms. Additionally, participants were asked if they thought that pain
  was related to/part of HNPP. 32/43 (74%) subjects with HNPP had persistent
  pain and experience this pain in the last week. Of those with pain, 24 (75%)
  were likely to have neuropathic pain and 27 (84%) were likely to have central
  sensitisation. All 32 participants felt that their pain could be related
  to/part of their HNPP. Significant negative impact of the pain was common.
  Pain characterisation identified neuropathic pain and/or central sensitisation
  as common, potential underlying processes. Pain may plausibly be directly
  related to the underlying pathophysiology of HNPP. Further consideration of
  including pain as a primary symptom of HNPP is warranted.
