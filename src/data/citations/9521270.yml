  PCR-based strategy for the diagnosis of hereditary neuropathy with liability
  to pressure palsies and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A.
abstract: >-
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are inherited peripheral neuropathies. In
  most cases these disorders are caused by either the duplication (in CMT1A) or
  the deletion (in HNPP) of a 1.5-megabase DNA fragment on chromosome 17p11.2,
  which contains the peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (PMP22). We developed a
  rapid and simple quantitative PCR assay for the detection of the CMT1A
  duplication or the HNPP deletion. The assay is based on the quantitative
  determination of the copy number of a 240-base pair DNA fragment from exon 4
  of the PMP22 gene. Quantification was done on an automated fluorescence
  sequencer. Using this method we analyzed four families with the HNPP
  phenotype. In these families we identified the deletion in all affected
  individuals. To test the validity of the method, we compared the quantitative
  PCR results from 50 DNA samples, including 15 samples from individuals with
  HNPP, 15 samples from CMT1A patients, and 20 from normal controls, with the
  results obtained by Southern blot analysis. Concordant results were obtained
  in 49 of the 50 cases.
