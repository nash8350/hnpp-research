  Clinical and electrophysiologic features of HNPP patients with 17p11.2
  deletion.
abstract: >-
  Although the diagnosis of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP) is important for correct prognostic evaluation and genetic
  counseling, the diagnosis is frequently missed or delayed. Our main aim on
  undertaking this study was to characterize the electrodiagnostic features of
  HNPP. Clinical, electrophysiologic and molecular studies were performed on
  Korean HNPP patients with 17p11.2 deletion. The results of electrophysiologic
  studies were compared with those of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 A
  (CMT1A) patients carrying 17p11.2 duplication. Eight HNPP (50 motor, 39
  sensory nerves) and six CMT1A (28 motor, 16 sensory nerves) patients were
  included. Sensory nerve conduction was slow in 97% of HNPP nerves. Motor nerve
  conduction at common entrapment sites was also abnormally slow in 87.5%,
  whereas at non-entrapment sites conduction slowing was infrequent. Distal
  motor latency (DML) was prolonged in 80% of HNPP nerves, and terminal latency
  index (TLI) was significantly lower in HNPP than in normal controls and in
  CMT1A patients (P < 0.01). In contrast to CMT1A, where severity of nerve
  conduction slowing was not different among nerve groups, HNPP sensory nerve
  conduction was more slowed in the median and ulnar nerves than in the sural
  nerve (P < 0.01), and DML was more prolonged in the median nerve than in the
  other motor nerves (P < 0.01). TLIs were significantly lower in HNPP than in
  the normal control and CMT1A patients for the median and ulnar nerves (P <
  0.01), and were also significantly reduced for the peroneal nerve (P < 0.05)
  compared with those of the normal controls. HNPP is characterized
  electrophysiologically by a generalized neuropathy, superimposed by focal
  entrapment neuropathies. The slowing of sensory conduction in nearly all
  nerves and the distal accentuation of motor conduction abnormalities are the
  main features of background polyneuropathy in HNPP. The distribution and
  severity of the background electrophysiologic abnormalities are closely
  related to the topography of common entrapment or compression sites, which
  suggests the possible pathogenetic role of subclinical pressure injury at
  these sites in the development of the distinct background polyneuropathy in
  HNPP.
