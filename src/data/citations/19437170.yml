abstract: >-
  We describe the rare case of a young woman with hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to compression palsy (HNPP), who developed a rapidly progressive
  ALS. We suggest that underexpression of PMP22 protein in the nervous system
  might interfere with motor neuron function by impairing myelin formation and
  exposure of the axon to injury. Patients with ALS and evidence of
  demyelination should be screened for HNPP.
