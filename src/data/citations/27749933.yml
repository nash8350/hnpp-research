  The PMP22 gene encodes a protein integral to peripheral myelin. Its deletion
  leads to hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP).
  PMP22 is not expressed in the adult central nervous system, but previous
  studies suggest a role in CNS myelin development. The objective of this study
  was to identify potential structural and functional alterations in the
  afferent visual system in HNPP patients. Twenty HNPP patients and 18 matched
  healthy controls (HC) were recruited in a cross-sectional study. Participants
  underwent neurological examination including visual acuity, visual evoked
  potential (VEP) examination, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and magnetic
  resonance imaging with calculation of brain atrophy, regarding grey and white
  matter, and voxel based morphometry (VBM), in addition answered the National
  Eye Institute's 39-item Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ). Thirteen
  patients and 6 HC were additionally examined with magnetic resonance
  spectroscopy (MRS). All patients had normal visual acuity, but reported
  reduced peripheral vision in comparison to HC in the NEI-VFQ (p = 0.036). VEP
  latency was prolonged in patients (P100 = 103.7±5.7 ms) in comparison to
  healthy subjects (P100 = 99.7±4.2 ms, p = 0.007). In OCT, peripapillary
  retinal nerve fiber layer thickness RNFL was decreased in the nasal sector
  (90.0±15.5 vs. 101.8±16.5, p = 0.013), and lower nasal sector RNFL correlated
  with prolonged VEP latency (Rho = -0.405, p = 0.012). MRS revealed reduced
  tNAA (731.4±45.4 vs. 814.9±62.1, p = 0.017) and tCr (373.8±22.2 vs.
  418.7±31.1, p = 0.002) in the visual cortex in patients vs. HC. Whole brain
  volume, grey and white matter volume, VBM and metabolites in a MRS sensory
  cortex control voxel did not differ significantly between patients and HC.
  PMP22 deletion leads to functional, metabolic and macro-structural alterations
  in the afferent visual system of HNPP patients. Our data suggest a functional
  relevance of these changes for peripheral vision, which warrants further
  investigation and confirmation.
