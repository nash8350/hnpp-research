  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is characterized
  by recurrent focal neuropathies, which usually become symptomatic in the
  second or third decade of life. However, clinical phenotypic heterogeneity
  among patients with HNPP has recently been reported. Certain patients show
  polyneuropathy-type diffuse nerve injuries, whereas others remain asymptomatic
  at older ages. We present two cases of elderly-onset bilateral peroneal nerve
  palsies with diffuse muscle weakness in the lower limbs and glove-and-stocking
  type sensory disturbance. Both patients were diagnosed with HNPP by genetic
  analyses that detected deletions of chromosome 17p11.2 in peripheral myelin
  protein 22 genes. Their clinical courses suggested that the Japanese sitting
  style termed 'seiza', a way of sitting on the floor with the lower legs
  crossed under the thighs, was a precipitating factor for the bilateral
  peroneal nerve palsies.
