  [Hereditary neuropathy with pressure hypersensitivity or tomaculous
  neuropathy].
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy liability to pressure palsies is characterized by
  recurring accesses of painless paralysis at the level of various nerves likely
  to be compressed. This affection remains underdiagnosed because of its usually
  benign course, sometimes without any symptom. The diagnosis is supported by
  clinical and electrophysiological data associated with, in the majority of
  patients, a deletion of one of the alleles coding for protein PMP 22 on the
  level of the locus 17p11.2.
