  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) is a common autosomal dominant
  demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. Most patients with CMT1A have been found
  to have a 1.5 megabase tandem DNA duplication in chromosome 17p11.2-12.
  Meiotic unequal crossover mediated by the CMT1A-REP repeat is a proposed
  mechanism for generation of the duplication in CMT1A and a reciprocal deletion
  seen in hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Testing for
  the CMT1A duplication is frequently the first step in the molecular diagnosis
  of patients with suspected inherited demyelinating neuropathy. We used a 1.0
  kb EcoRI-PstI DNA fragment (pHK1.0P) from the proximal CMT1A-REP repeat as a
  probe for Southern blot analysis and detected increased gene dosage in CMT1A
  by determining measuring radioactivity ratios with a photostimulated
  luminescence imaging plate. We found that this method is useful for rapid
  diagnosis of the DNA duplication associated with CMT1A.
