  J.M. and H.G. are two unrelated male patients with developmental delay.
  Cytogenetic analysis detected a duplication of 17p11.2 in both patients. The
  extent of the duplicated region was determined using single copy DNA probes
  cen-D17S58-D17S29-D17S258-D17S71-D17S445-+ ++D17S122-tel. Four of the six
  markers, D17S29, D17S258, D17S71, and D17S445, were duplicated by dosage
  analysis. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of H.G., using
  cosmids for locus D17S29, confirmed the duplication in 17p11.2. Because the
  deletion that causes the Smith-Magnesis syndrome involves the same region of
  17p11.2 as the duplication in these patients, the mechanism may be similar to
  that proposed for the reciprocal deletion/duplication event observed in
  Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP) and
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 1A disease (CMT1A).
