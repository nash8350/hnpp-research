  We describe a 6-year-old girl with a T118M PMP22 mutation and heterozygous
  deletion of PMP22 on chromosome 17 (17p11.2-p12) resulting in a severe
  sensorimotor polyneuropathy. This study is a case report in which the relevant
  mutations are described. Foot pain, cavovarus feet, tibialis anterior atrophy,
  absent reflexes, and inability to walk were found when the patient was age 6
  years. Nerve conduction studies showed evidence of a sensorimotor
  polyneuropathy and compressive mononeuropathies of bilateral median nerves at
  the wrist and ulnar nerves at the elbow. Genetic testing revealed deletion of
  a PMP22 allele and T118M PMP22 mutation in the remaining allele. The severe
  sensorimotor polyneuropathy and hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP) in this patient was likely a consequence of both
  decreased expression of PMP22 causing features consistent with HNPP and
  unopposed expression of the T118M mutant form of PMP22 that is relatively
  benign in the heterozygous state. The T118M mutant form of PMP22 can be
  disease-modifying in the appropriate circumstances.
