  Novel PCR-based diagnostic tools for Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A and
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.
abstract: >-
  The majority of cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are the result of DNA
  duplications and deletions respectively of a 1.5 Mb region on 17p11.2. The
  region contains the peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (PMP-22) and is flanked
  by homologous proximal and distal CMT1A-REP elements. The majority of
  duplications and deletions arise during meiotic recombination following
  misalignment and unequal crossing-over between the proximal and distal
  CMT1A-REP elements. The cross-over breakpoints are most frequently located
  within a 1.7 Kb hotspot of recombination and produce novel duplication or
  deletion junctional CMT1A-REPs with unique restriction patterns. Here we
  describe the use of PCR based tests, which amplify a 3.6 Kb region including
  the 1.7 Kb hotspot from specific CMT1A-REPs, for the rapid diagnosis of CMT1A
  and HNPP patients. In an analysis of 96 CMT1A and 30 HNPP patients,
  duplication and deletion events were detected in all samples with cross-over
  breakpoints known to be within the region amplified by PCR.
