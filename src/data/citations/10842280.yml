title: Fulminant case of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is typified as
  isolated nerve palsies caused by trivial compression or trauma. It rarely
  presents in two extremities and even more infrequently affects all four limbs
  simultaneously. We present a patient who concurrently experienced right
  shoulder, left hand, and bilateral foot weakness mimicking several multifocal
  conditions. Electromyography suggested HNPP and subsequent nerve biopsy and
  genetic testing were confirmatory. The case demonstrates that HNPP can present
  in a fulminant manner and should be included in the differential diagnosis of
  acute multiple mononeuropathies. The possible causes for such a rapid clinical
  course in our patient are discussed.
