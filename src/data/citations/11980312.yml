  We looked for electrodiagnostic features that raise suspicion of hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). A retrospective review
  of eight cases with confirmed histologic (one case) or chromosome 17 deletion
  (seven cases) analysis was performed. Autosomal dominant disease was present
  in 63% of the patients, 75% being men. Mean age at examination and at first
  symptom was 27 and 22 years respectively. Five patients have one or more acute
  nerve palsies, without residual deficit, but one presented sensory symptoms in
  internal saphena territory. Three patients had others phenotypes a man
  presented with four episodes of facial palsy and one woman was asymptomatic;
  another patient with diabetes mellitus presented an associated chronic
  sensorimotor polyneuropathy. In agreement with other studies of HNPP we found
  in most patients a diffuse increase in distal motor latence, contrasting with
  normal or moderately decreased motor nerve conduction velocity, multiple
  electrophysiologic entrapment and diffuse reduction in sensory nerve action
  potential and/or velocity. However, this electrophysiological pattern was
  incomplete or masked in HNPP with cranial nerves palsies, in asymptomatic form
  of HNPP or in HNPP associated with polyneuropathy. These data confirm the
  clinical phenotypic heterogeneity of the 17p11.2 deletion and highlight the
  limits of the classic electrophysiological pattern in asymptomatic HNPP or
  associated with uncommon clinical features.
