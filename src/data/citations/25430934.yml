  CMT subtypes and disease burden in patients enrolled in the Inherited
  Neuropathies Consortium natural history study a cross-sectional analysis.
abstract: >-
  The international Inherited Neuropathy Consortium (INC) was created with the
  goal of obtaining much needed natural history data for patients with
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. We analysed clinical and genetic data from
  patients in the INC to determine the distribution of CMT subtypes and the
  clinical impairment associated with them. We analysed data from 1652 patients
  evaluated at 13 INC centres. The distribution of CMT subtypes and pathogenic
  genetic mutations were determined. The disease burden of all the mutations was
  assessed by the CMT Neuropathy Score (CMTNS) and CMT Examination Score
  (CMTES). 997 of the 1652 patients (60.4%) received a genetic diagnosis. The
  most common CMT subtypes were CMT1A/PMP22 duplication, CMT1X/GJB1 mutation,
  CMT2A/MFN2 mutation, CMT1B/MPZ mutation, and hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsy/PMP22 deletion. These five subtypes of CMT
  accounted for 89.2% of all genetically confirmed mutations. Mean CMTNS for
  some but not all subtypes were similar to those previously reported. Our
  findings confirm that large numbers of patients with a representative variety
  of CMT subtypes have been enrolled and that the frequency of achieving a
  molecular diagnosis and distribution of the CMT subtypes reflects those
  previously reported. Measures of severity are similar, though not identical,
  to results from smaller series. This study confirms that it is possible to
  assess patients in a uniform way between international centres, which is
  critical for the planned natural history study and future clinical trials.
  These data will provide a representative baseline for longitudinal studies of
  CMT. ID number NCT01193075.
