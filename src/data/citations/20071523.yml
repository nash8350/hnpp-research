  Patients with PMP22 deficiency present with focal sensory and motor deficits
  when peripheral nerves are stressed by mechanical force. It has been
  hypothesized that these focal deficits are due to mechanically induced
  conduction block (CB). To test this hypothesis, we induced 60-70% CB (defined
  by electrophysiological criteria) by nerve compression in an authentic mouse
  model of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) with
  an inactivation of one of the two pmp22 alleles (pmp22(+/-)). Induction time
  for the CB was significantly shorter in pmp22(+/-) mice than that in
  pmp22(+/+) mice. This shortened induction was also found in myelin-associated
  glycoprotein knock-out mice, but not in the mice with deficiency of myelin
  protein zero, a major structural protein of compact myelin. Pmp22(+/-) nerves
  showed intact tomacula with no segmental demyelination in both noncompressed
  and compressed conditions, normal molecular architecture, and normal
  concentration of voltage-gated sodium channels by [(3)H]-saxitoxin binding
  assay. However, focal constrictions were observed in the axonal segments
  enclosed by tomacula, a pathological hallmark of HNPP. The constricted axons
  increase axial resistance to action potential propagation, which may hasten
  the induction of CB in Pmp22 deficiency. Together, these results demonstrate
  that a function of Pmp22 is to protect the nerve from mechanical injury.
