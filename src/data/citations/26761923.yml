  The phenotype HNPP (hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies)
  is caused by heterozygous deletion of the PMP22 gene. HNPP is clinically
  characterized by asymmetric focal sensory loss and muscle weakness. Reports of
  HNPP have been rare. In this article, we report the case of an asymptomatic
  woman with the HNPP mutation. After undergoing total knee arthroplasty, she
  developed a footdrop with prolonged recovery. We concluded (a) that the HNPP
  mutation may carry a high risk for certain surgical procedures not expected to
  cause neurologic deficits in normal patients and (b) that humans with the HNPP
  mutation can be asymptomatic. Lack of symptoms can contribute to
  underrecognition of the disease.
