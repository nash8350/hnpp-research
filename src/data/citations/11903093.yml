title: Familial carpal tunnel syndrome a report of a Finnish family.
abstract: >-
  The existence of familial carpal tunnel syndrome (FCTS) as a separate
  autonomic entity has been discussed during the last few years. In order to
  contribute with more data to the literature, we report here the results of
  clinical. electrophysiological, pathological and radiological studies
  performed in 5 patients belonging to the same Finnish pedigree. The disease
  appeared usually before the second decade with numbness and pain on the I--III
  digits. In most patients symptoms were unilateral but within 2 years they
  became bilateral. In all patients typical electrophysiological features of
  median nerve entrapment have been recorded. X-rays of the wrist showed narrow
  carpal tunnel in all patients. In all patients the possibility of having HNPP
  as well as familial amyloidosis has been excluded by molecular genetic and
  pathological studies. All patients underwent surgery and at postoperative
  stage symptoms were relieved or completely disappeared. Our study supports the
  theory that FCTS exists as a separate autonomic entity, therefore it is
  important in front of a sporadic case to investigate the family occurrence of
  CTS.
