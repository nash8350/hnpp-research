  Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy Manifesting as Neuropathy
  With Liability to Pressure Palsies A Case Report.
abstract: >-
  Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a progressive
  demyelinating neuropathy, which typically presents with proximal and distal
  neuropathic symptoms and is typically responsive to immunomodulatory
  therapies. Many variants have been subsequently described in the literature
  and have similarly shown to be responsive to immunotherapy. We present a case
  of a 43-year-old Middle Eastern/Arabic man presenting with symptoms of mixed
  sensorimotor neuropathy most evident at entrapment sites mimicking hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. His electrodiagnostic study
  revealed features of acquired demyelinating neuropathy and a negative genetic
  workup. Alternative diagnosis of CIDP was considered in the context of
  symptomatic disease progression, negative genetic workup, and electrodiagnosis
  leading to initiation of immunotherapy with intravenous immunoglobulins. His
  neuropathy responded confirming our diagnosis of an inflammatory demyelinating
  polyneuropathy. We describe a previously unknown variant of CIDP with
  phenotypic characteristics of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies and its potential for successful treatment with intravenous
  immunoglobulins. This case illustrates an unusual presentation of CIDP
  mimicking hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.
