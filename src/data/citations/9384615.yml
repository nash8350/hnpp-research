  The molecular mechanism resulting in the duplication or deletion of a 1.5 Mb
  region of 17p11.2-p12, associated, respectively, with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type
  1A (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  (HNPP), has been proposed to be an unequal crossing-over during meiosis
  between the two chromosome 17 homologues generated by misalignment of the
  proximal and distal CMT1A-REP repeats, two homologous sequences flanking the
  1.5 Mb CMT1A/HNPP monomer unit. In a recent study of a large series of de novo
  cases of CMT1A and HNPP, two distinct sex-dependent mechanisms were
  identified. Rearrangements of paternal origin, essentially duplications, were
  indeed generated by unequal meiotic crossing-over between the two chromosome
  17 homologues, but duplications and deletions of maternal origin resulted from
  an intrachromosomal process, either unequal sister chromatid exchange or, in
  the case of deletion, excision of an intrachromatidal loop. In order to
  determine how these recombinations occur, 24 de novo crossover breakpoints
  were localized within the 1.7 kb rearrangement hot spot by comparing the
  sequences of the parental CMT1A-REPs with the chimeric copy in affected
  offspring. Nineteen out of 21 paternal crossovers were found in a 741 bp hot
  spot. All the breakpoints of maternal origin (n = 3), however, were located
  outside this interval, but in closely flanking sequences, supporting the
  hypothesis that two distinct sex-dependent mechanisms are involved. Several
  putative recombination promoting sequences in the hot spot, which are rare or
  absent in the surrounding 7.8 kb, were identified.
