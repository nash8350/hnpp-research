  Peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) is a small, hydrophobic glycoprotein,
  which is most prominently expressed by Schwann cells as a component of compact
  myelin of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Recent progress in molecular
  genetics revealed that mutations affecting the PMP22 gene including
  duplications, deletions, and point mutations are responsible for the most
  common forms of hereditary peripheral neuropathies including
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), and a subtype of Dejerine-Sottas
  Syndrome (DSS). Functionally, PMP22 is involved in correct myelination during
  development of peripheral nerves, the stability of myelin, and the maintenance
  of axons. While most of these functions relate to a role of PMP22 as a
  structural component of myelin, PMP22 has also been proposed as a regulator of
  Schwann cell proliferation and differentiation. In this review, we will
  discuss our current knowledge of PMP22 and its related proteins in the normal
  organism as well as in disease. In particular, we will focus on how the
  function of PMP22 and its regulation may be relevant to particular disease
  mechanisms.
