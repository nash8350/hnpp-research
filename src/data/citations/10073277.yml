  Hereditary peripheral neuropathies clinical forms, genetics, and molecular
  mechanisms.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary peripheral neuropathies, among the most common genetic disorders in
  humans, are a complex, clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of
  disorders that produce progressive deterioration of the peripheral nerves.
  This group of disorders includes hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome, and
  congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy. Our understanding of these disorders
  has progressed from the description of the clinical phenotypes and delineation
  of the electrophysiologic and pathologic features to the identification of
  disease genes and elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanisms.
