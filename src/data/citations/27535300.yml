  In order to generate tridentate enamido diphosphine ligand platforms, we
  developed procedures for the preparation of tBuPCHCHP(tBu)I, which involve low
  temperatures, pentane solvent and addition of 4 equiv. of tBuLi to
  ClPCHCHPClor 2 equiv. of tBuLi to known Cl(tBu)PCHCHP(tBu)Cl also at low
  temperatures in pentane; an alternate method involves the inverse addition of
  Cl(tBu)PCHCHP(tBu)Cl to 2 equiv. of tBuLi in pentane at 0 Â°C; all of these
  methods generate good yields of the tetraphosphine dimer
  (tBuPCHCHP(tBu))contaminated by small amounts of tBuPCHCHPtBu(dtbpe), which
  can be conveniently separated by sublimation. Subsequent oxidative cleavage of
  the P-P bond with Ior 1,2-diiodoethane results in the formation of the desired
  tBuPCHCHP(tBu)I, which undergoes C-P bond formation when added to 1 equiv. of
  the lithium N-2,6-diisopropylphenylenamide of cyclopentylidene imine to
  generate the HNPP ligand precursor; this species exists as a tautomeric
  mixture of the corresponding enamine and imine, the ratio of which depends on
  workup conditions used. This enamine-imine mixture can be used directly to
  form Ru(ii) species either directly with heating to generate the
  five-coordinate (NPP)RuCl(CO) via loss of Hor by inclusion of 1 equiv. of
  KOtBu to generate (NPP)RuH(CO). X-ray crystallographic studies confirm that
  the geometry in the solid state matches the solution spectroscopic data.
  Subsequent studies of (NPP)RuH(CO) indicate that it reacts with benzaldehyde,
  benzyl alcohol, and Hin a cooperative manner to generate a series of hydride
  carbonyls that have been characterized fully by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray
  crystallography.
