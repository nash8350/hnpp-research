  Sensorineural hearing impairment in patients with Pmp22 duplication, deletion,
  and frameshift mutations.
abstract: >-
  To characterize and distinguish the types of sensorineural hearing impairment
  (SNHI) that occur in hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy Type 1a (HMSN-1a)
  and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), which are
  caused by deletion or frameshift mutation. Prospective study. Ambulatory
  patients in a university hospital. Twelve patients with HMSN-1a due to a
  duplication of the PMP22 gene on chromosome 17p11.2, 16 patients with HNPP due
  to the common PMP22 deletion (HNPP del), and 11 HNPP patients with a frame
  shift mutation (heterozygous PMP22 G-insertion) (HNPP mut), all confirmed by
  molecular genetic analysis. Pure-tone audiograms and speech audiograms were
  obtained. Results of cross-sectional analysis comprising linear regression of
  hearing threshold on age. Pure-tone audiograms showed mild to moderate SNHI,
  predominant at the low and the high frequencies. SNHI showed significant
  progression by approximately 0.4 dB per year at 0.25 to 4 kHz and up to 1 to 2
  dB per year at 4 to 8 kHz. Patients with HMSN-1a had substantial, presumably
  congenital, SNHI but did not show significant progression beyond presbyacusis.
  Patients with HNPP showed postnatal onset at age 11 years with progression of
  SNHI in excess of presbyacusis by 0.4 dB per year. All three types of
  neuropathy showed normal speech recognition. All three types of neuropathy
  showed SNHI with normal speech recognition. HMSN-1a showed stable SNHI without
  progression beyond presbyacusis. HNPP showed progression beyond presbyacusis
  with postnatal onset. The differences in SNHI may be explained by the
  differences in PMP22 expression. The progressive SNHI in HNPP might be
  explained by the liability for exogenous factors associated with this
  disorder.
