  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant disease characterized by recurrent episodes of acute nerve
  palsies. We performed a clinical, electrophysiologic, and molecular study of
  13 French families with HNPP associated with a chromosome 17p11.2 deletion in
  36 individuals. There were electrophysiologic abnormalities in all symptomatic
  (n = 28) and asymptomatic (n = 8) deletion carriers, even in childhood.
  Bilateral delayed distal motor latency of the median nerve at the wrist,
  reduced sensory velocity in the palm-wrist segment, and delayed distal motor
  latency or reduced motor velocity in the peroneal nerve was diagnostic in
  at-risk relatives. This large series confirms the reliability of molecular
  analysis combined with a simplified electrophysiologic examination for the
  diagnosis of HNPP associated with 17p11.2 deletion.
