  The links between neuropathies of the peripheral nervous system (PNS),
  including Charcot-Marie-Tooth1A and hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies, and impaired biomechanical and structural integrity of PNS
  nerves remain poorly understood despite the medical urgency. Here, we present
  a protocol describing simultaneous structural and biomechanical integrity
  investigations on isolated nerve fibers, the building blocks of nerves. Nerve
  fibers are prepared from nerves harvested from wild-type and exemplary PNS
  neuropathy mouse models. The basic principle of the designed experimental
  approach is based on the simultaneous combination of atomic force microscopy
  (AFM) and confocal microscopy. AFM is used to visualize the surface structure
  of nerve fibers at nano-scale resolution. The simultaneous combination of AFM
  and confocal microscopy is used to perform biomechanical, structural, and
  functional integrity measurements at nano- to micro-scale. Isolation of
  sciatic nerves and subsequent teasing of nerve fibers take ~45 min. Teased
  fibers can be maintained at 37Â°C in a culture medium and kept viable for up to
  6 h allowing considerable time for all measurements which require 3-4 h. The
  approach is designed to be widely applicable for nerve fibers from mice of any
  PNS neuropathy. It can be extended to human nerve biopsies.
