  Neurological complications of AH1N1 vaccination such as Guillain-Barr√©
  syndrome were described in the previous years. Several reports suggest that
  hereditary neuropathies may be a predisposing factor for immune-mediated
  neuropathies. We report the case of a 54-year-old female who developed chronic
  inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) 5 weeks after AH1N1
  vaccination. She had no previous neurological history, but neurophysiological
  features led us to suspect an underlying hereditary neuropathy. PMP22 gene
  analysis showed a typical deletion, confirming the diagnosis of hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). We observed a
  significant clinical and neurophysiological improvement of the neuropathy
  after intravenous immunoglobulin treatment. This is, to our knowledge, the
  first reported case of CIDP potentially triggered by AH1N1 vaccination. This
  and previous observations suggest that genetic-determined neuropathies could
  predispose to the occurrence of immune-mediated neuropathies. One must recall
  the possibility of a superimposed hereditary neuropathy like HNPP in patients
  with a clinical presentation of CIDP, especially when positive family history
  or unexpected neurophysiological features are present.
