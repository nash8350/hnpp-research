  We retrospectively analyzed paraffin-embedded sural nerve biopsy specimens
  from cases suspected of having dominantly inherited motor and sensory
  neuropathy (HMSN) or hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy
  (HNPP), with respect to their proportional DNA content at chromosome
  17p11.2-12, encompassing the PMP-22 gene, using polymerase chain reaction
  (PCR). Of 19 cases in whom HMSN Ia had been suspected on clinical,
  neurophysiological, and histopathological grounds, 14 showed a duplication on
  chromosome 17p11.2-12. A deletion in the identical chromosomal region could be
  identified in all of the suspected cases with HNPP. In 5 cases showing neither
  duplication, deletion, nor a point mutation in the exons of the PMP-22 gene on
  heteroduplex DNA analysis, the histopathological findings strongly suggested a
  diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy in 2 cases, and
  HMSN Ib, or HMSN non-a non-b, and HMSN III in 3 cases. It is shown for the
  first time that archival, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sural nerve biopsy
  samples can be used for establishing the diagnosis of PMP-22 diseases, i.e.,
  HMSN Ia and HNPP, by PCR amplification of the region coding for the PMP-22
  gene.
