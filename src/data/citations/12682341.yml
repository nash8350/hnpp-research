  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies the first publication
  (1947).
abstract: >-
  The first report of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  (HNPP) was published in Dutch in 1947. The present paper makes it accessible
  in the English language. de Jong described two families, but only the cases
  from the first family may be considered to have had HNPP. Five persons from
  three generations had recurring peripheral neuropathies. de Jong hypothesized
  a hereditary disposition for the occurrence of neuropathies, but suggested a
  relationship with low vitamin B(1) levels.
