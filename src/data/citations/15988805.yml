  The majority of cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) and of hereditary
  neuropathy with a liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are the result of
  heterozygosity for the duplication or deletion of peripheral myelin protein 22
  gene (PMP22) on 17p11.2. Southern blots, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
  (PFGE), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymorphic marker
  analysis are currently used diagnostic methods. But they are time-consuming,
  labor-intensive and have some significant limitations. We describe a rapid
  real- time quantitative PCR method for determining gene copy number for the
  identification of DNA duplication or deletion occurring in CMT1A or HNPP and
  compare the results obtained with REP-PCR. Six patients with CMT1A and 14
  patients with HNPP [confirmed by Repeat (REP)-PCR], and 16 patients with
  suspicious CMT1A and 13 patients with suspicious HNPP [negative REP-PCR], and
  15 normal controls were studied. We performed REP-PCR, which amplified a 3.6
  Kb region (including a 1.7Kb recombination hotspot), using specific CMT1A-REP
  and real-time quantitative PCR on the LightCycler system. Using a comparative
  threshold cycle (Ct) method and beta -globin as a reference gene, the gene
  copy number of the PMP22 gene was quantified. The PMP22 duplication ratio
  ranged from 1.35 to 1.74, and the PMP22 deletion ratio from 0.41 to 0.53. The
  PMP22 ratio in normal controls ranged from 0.81 to 1.12. All 6 patients with
  CMT1A and 14 patients with HNPP confirmed by REP-PCR were positive by
  real-time quantitative PCR. Among the 16 suspicious CMT1A and 13 suspicious
  HNPP with negative REP-PCR, 2 and 4 samples, respectively, were positive by
  real-time quantitative PCR. Real-time quantitative PCR is a more sensitive and
  more accurate method than REP-PCR for the detection of PMP22 duplications or
  deletions, and it is also faster and easier than currently available methods.
  Therefore, we believe that the real-time quantitative method is useful for
  diagnosing CMT1A and HNPP.
