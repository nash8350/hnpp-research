  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is a disease
  that presents with recurrent reversible episodes of neurapraxia that occur
  typically after trivial trauma. It is an autosomal dominant, demyelinating
  neuropathy. A 20-year-old man presented with left ulnar nerve palsy after a
  fall. He had reduced two-point discrimination over his left ulnar nerve
  distribution, with mild clawing of the ring and little fingers, and
  accompanying weakness of the first dorsal interrosseus and abductor digiti
  minimi of grade four power. His Froment's sign was also positive. Careful
  clinical examination and appropriate tests, including electromyography and
  genetic testing, confirmed the diagnosis of HNPP. This case report is
  presented to promote awareness and recognition of this disease in the local
  and regional context.
