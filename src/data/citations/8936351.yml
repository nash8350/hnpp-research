  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is a
  peripheral nerve disorder characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance,
  recurrent pressure palsies, reduced motor and sensory conduction velocities
  and sausage-like swellings (tomacula) of myelin sheaths in nerve biopsy. Two
  young adult patients are reported as index cases of two families in which HNPP
  was diagnosed. The first patient presented with recurrent pressure palsies,
  whereas the second suffered from fasciculations and myokymias in his right
  hand, with difficulty in writing, and upper and lower limb paraesthesias of 3
  years' duration. Electrodiagnostic studies revealed slowing of conduction
  primarily in common sites of compression in both patients. Sural nerve biopsy
  revealed the characteristic tomaculous swellings in both patients. DNA
  analysis showed that both patients have a deletion in chromosome 17p11.2 which
  is found in the majority of HNPP cases. In light of the common molecular
  defect, the different clinical symptomatology of the two patients is
  discussed.
