  Some evidences highlighted a higher clinical expression of hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) in males, and a higher load
  of traumatic nerve injuries due to different occupational activity has been
  invoked to explain this observation. It is unknown whether this increased
  clinical impairment corresponds to a greater electrophysiological involvement.
  Thus, we compared clinical and electrophysiological features between men and
  women in a large cohort of HNPP patients. Nerve palsies and
  electrophysiological abnormalities were more frequent in men, and
  electrophysiological findings which differentiated males from females did not
  show any age-related worsening. In conclusion, our findings showed a higher
  clinical and electrophysiological involvement in males which does not seem
  related to different cumulative nerve damage over time. We believe that the
  higher disease expression may increase the chance to detect the disease in
  males and, thereby, to underestimate the HNPP diagnosis in females.
