  There has been limited information from population studies regarding the
  overall frequency of the common 1.5-Mb 17p11.2 deletion and even scarcer data
  regarding the overall frequency of PMP22 micromutations in patients with a
  clinical suspicion of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  (HNPP). We have analysed 100 consecutive Greek patients referred for HNPP
  genetic testing over a 15-year period to our Neurogenetics Unit in Athens, a
  reference centre for all regions of Greece. All patients were screened for the
  1.5-Mb deletion and a selected subgroup of deletion-negative patients for
  PMP22 micromutations. Mutation-positive and mutation-negative patients were
  compared for various clinical parameters. In total, 54 mutation-positive
  patients were identified. In index cases, the deletion frequency was 47.8%,
  and the PMP22 micromutation frequency was 2.2%. Within mutation-positive
  patients, the common deletion represented 95.7% and PMP22 micromutations 4.3%
  of cases. Two previously reported PMP22 micromutations (c.364_365delCC and
  c.79-2A>G) were detected. HNPP index cases had a 2.8-1 male-to-female ratio,
  similar to mutation-negative patients. A typical phenotype (recurrent or
  isolated palsies) was present in 82.4% of symptomatic HNPP cases,
  significantly higher than mutation-negative patients. Sensitivity of proposed
  electrophysiological diagnostic criteria for HNPP was calculated at 95.7% and
  specificity at 80.5%. In conclusion, the common HNPP deletion accounts for
  ∼50% and PMP22 micromutations for ∼2% of cases in a large consecutive cohort
  of patients with suspected HNPP. The mutational and phenotypic spectrum of
  HNPP is similar in the Greek population compared with other populations.
  Proposed electrophysiological diagnostic criteria perform satisfactorily in
  everyday clinical practice.
