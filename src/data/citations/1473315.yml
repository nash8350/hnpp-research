  Sensory-motor chronic neuropathy in two siblings atypical presentation of
  tomaculous neuropathy.
abstract: >-
  Two siblings, born from a consanguineous marriage, in which tomaculous
  neuropathy (TN), diagnosed after nerve biopsy, presented as a chronic
  sensory-motor neuropathy. The clinical manifestations include also in both
  patients thyroid multinodular struma and in one case myopathic-like features.
  We believe that TN must be suspected not only in hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies, but also in any case with chronic sensory-motor
  neuropathy.
