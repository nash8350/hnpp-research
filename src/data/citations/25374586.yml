  Genetic factors may be learnt from families with gene mutations that render
  nerve-injury susceptibility even to ordinary physical activities. A typical
  example is hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP).
  HNPP is caused by a heterozygous deletion of PMP22 gene. PMP22 deficiency
  disrupts myelin junctions (such as tight junction and adherens junctions),
  leading to abnormally increased myelin permeability that explains the nerve
  susceptibility to injury. This finding should motivate investigators to
  identify additional genetic factors contributing to nerve vulnerability of
  injury.
