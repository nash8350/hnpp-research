  A prokaryotic in situ polymerase chain reaction (PI-PCR) technique was applied
  to visualize Vibrio halioticoli cells using alginate lyase gene alyVG2 as a
  target gene. Prior to PI-PCR, a primer set, VG2-OS3, for specific
  amplification of an approximately 1.0-kb fragment from V. halioticoli genomic
  DNA was developed with amplified fragments from V. pelagius and V. fischeri
  DNAs as reference strains. One-stage PI-PCR using the primer set,
  digoxigenin-labeled dUTP, and indirect alkaline-phosphatase-linked
  fluorescence detection technique (HNPP/Fast Red TR as a substrate) failed to
  differentiate V. halioticoli IAM14596(T) cells from ATCC25916(T) cells of the
  closely related species V. pelagius. However, two-stage PI-PCR adding the
  extension and digoxigenin-labeling step of the amplified fragment into the
  first amplification stage allowed us to differentiate V. halioticoli cells
  from V. pelagius cells.
