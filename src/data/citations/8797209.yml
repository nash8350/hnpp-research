  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant neuropathy recently reported to be associated with deletion
  of the peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP-22) gene. We report a 39-year-old man
  with recurrent brachial plexopathy and foot drop complicated by uncontrolled
  diabetes mellitus (DM). Right foot drop occurred at 31 years of the age and
  the patient subsequently experienced difficulty in raising his right arm.
  Neurological examination revealed weakness of the right deltoid, biceps
  muscles and tibialis anterior muscles. Deep tendon reflexes were generally
  absent. Sensory nerve conduction velocities in th ulnar, median and sural
  nerves were prolonged. Serum glucose and HB Alc levels were elevated to 468
  mg/dl and 12.5%, respectively. Initially, it was difficult to diagnose the
  neuropathy as HNPP because the patient had poorly controlled diabetes mellitus
  and was unaware of similar disease in his family. In addition, focal
  asymmetric motor neuropathy and good recovery can develop in diabetes
  mellitus, occasionally with recurrence. We were able to make a final diagnosis
  of HNPP by detecting deletion of the PMP-22 gene region. After the diagnosis
  was confirmed, we examined the patient's family and found that his father
  experienced recurrent episodes of bilateral foot drop. This case suggests that
  gene analysis is sometimes essential in the differential diagnosis of
  hereditary peripheral neuropathies.
