title: Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is an autosomal
  dominant disease with sensory and motor nerve palsies usually precipitated by
  trivial trauma or compression. In the majority of cases HNPP is caused by
  deletion of the peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (PMP22) on chromosome
  17p11.2. The authors present a family case with genetically proven HNPP.
