  Screening for Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A and hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsy in archival nerve biopsy samples by
  direct-double-differential PCR.
abstract: >-
  Chromosomal imbalance of the peripheral myelin protein-22 gene (PMP22) is
  known to be the most frequent genetic abnormality in Charcot-Marie-Tooth
  disease type 1 (CMT1) and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsy (HNPP). We applied a new quantitative PCR method, the
  direct-double-differential PCR (dddPCR), to the gene dosage determination of
  PMP22. The method allows the quantification of the PMP22 gene copy number
  independently from DNA fragmentation, even in highly degraded DNA from up to
  12-year-old sural nerve biopsy samples. Chromosomal imbalance of the PMP22
  gene, which had been detected by examination of four microsatellites located
  directly adjacent to the PMP22 gene, between the CMT1A-repetition (CMT1A-REP)
  elements was reliably confirmed by the dddPCR. Using this method we
  unexpectedly identified two cases with PMP22 imbalance, although
  morphologically the neuropathies were of a neuronal or axonal type and not of
  a demyelinating type as usual. One sural nerve biopsy was from a 58-year-old
  male diabetes mellitus patient with a disproportionately severe polyneuropathy
  showing a heterozygous duplication of PMP22. The second biopsy exhibiting a
  heterozygous deletion of PMP22 was from a 58-year-old female patient with a
  more axonal than demyelinating type of neuropathy without typical tomaculous
  changes seemingly altered by exogenous, possibly traumatic factors other than
  diabetes mellitus. Thus, the dddPCR provides a fast and reliable diagnostic
  tool for the screening and identification of CMTIA and HNPP cases, which is
  fast and may be essential even when nerve biopsies show morphologically
  atypical changes.
