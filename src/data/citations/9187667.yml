  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP) are two inherited peripheral neuropathies. The most
  prevalent mutations are a reciprocal 1.5-Mb duplication and 1.5-Mb deletion,
  respectively, at the CMT1A/HNPP locus on chromosome 17p11.2. Point mutations
  in the coding region of the myelin genes, peripheral myelin protein 22
  (PMP22), myelin protein zero (MPZ) or connexin 32 (Cx32) have been reported in
  CMT patients, including CMT type 1 (CMT1), CMT type 2 (CMT2) and
  Déjérine-Sottas neuropathy (DS) patients, and only in the coding region of
  PMP22 in HNPP families lacking a deletion. We have investigated point and
  small mutations in the MPZ, PMP22 and Cx32 genes in a series of patients of
  Spanish ancestry 47 CMT patients without duplications, and 5 HNPP patients
  without deletions. We found 15 different mutations in 16 CMT patients (34%).
  Nine different mutations in ten patients were detected in the Cx32 gene, this
  being the most frequently involved gene in this series, whereas five mutations
  involved the MPZ gene and only one the PMP22 gene. Six out of nine nucleotide
  substitutions in the Cx32 gene involved two codons encoding arginine at
  positions 164 and 183, suggesting that these two codons may constitute two
  Cx32 regions prone to mutate in the Spanish population. Analysis of HNPP
  patients revealed a 5' splicing mutation in intron 1 of the PMP22 gene in a
  family with autosomal dominance, which confirms allelic heterogeneity in HNPP.
  Ectopic mRNA analysis on leukocytes suggests that this mutation might behave
  as a null allele.
