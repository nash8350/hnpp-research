  Are electrophysiological criteria useful in distinguishing childhood
  demyelinating neuropathies?
abstract: >-
  Childhood chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) needs to be
  differentiated from hereditary neuropathy. We aimed to validate existing CIDP
  nerve conduction study (NCS) criteria in a group of children with
  demyelinating neuropathies of chronic or subacute onset. Retrospective
  analysis of clinical and NCS results in 18 children with CIDP, 7 with
  hereditary neuropathy with pressure palsy (HNPP), and 24 with
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1a (CMT1a). AAN and EFNS electrodiagnostic CIDP criteria
  were fulfilled in 17 of 18 CIDP, 3 of 7 HNPP, and 23 of 24 CMT1a patients. A
  distal compound muscle action potential (dCMAP) of >9 ms was observed in 14 of
  18 CIDP patients but not in any patients with HNPP. Abnormal median/normal
  sural SNAP (AMNS) and a 10 m/s difference between conduction velocities (CV)
  of two corresponding nerves were not observed in any CMT1a patients. NCS in
  CMT1a, HNPP, and CIDP reflect demyelination. dCMAP duration, sensory AMNS, and
  a 10 m/s CV difference parameter are most useful in the differential diagnosis
  of pediatric CIDP.
