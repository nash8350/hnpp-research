  Determination of gene dosage at the PMP22 and androgen receptor loci by
  quantitative PCR.
abstract: >-
  Although many genetic diseases are caused by the presence of point mutations
  in respective genes, an increasing number of diseases are known to be caused
  by gene copy number changes. We report the development of a rapid and reliable
  PCR-based method for quantitation of gene copy number with sufficient
  sensitivity to detect single copy changes without the use of radioactive or
  fluorescent labeling. The sensitivity of this technique has been demonstrated
  by the detection of the DNA duplication or deletion occurring in two inherited
  peripheral neuropathies, Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), that are caused by a
  reciprocal duplication or deletion event on chromosome 17p11.2-12. This method
  relies on the comparison of the amount of PCR product generated from a
  potentially duplicated or deleted target sequence with the amount of product
  generated from a disomic reference gene. The value of this ratio (target PCR
  productreference PCR product) indicates whether the target sequence is
  duplicated, deleted, or unchanged. Using primers from within a duplicated or
  deleted region (PMP22 gene and EW401) and from within a reference region (NF1
  gene), we tested 50 CMT1A, 30 HNPP, and 50 unaffected individuals for the
  presence of a DNA duplication or deletion. reference ratios of 1.58, 1.02, and
  0.56 were detected for the CMT1A, unaffected, and HNPP groups, respectively.
  Thus, differentiation of the three groups of individuals was on the basis of
  gene copy number. This technique was successfully used to detect the
  difference in the X chromosome copy number between males and females
  (targetreference ratios of 1.1 and 2.3, respectively). This approach to the
  detection of DNA duplications and deletions is sensitive, accurate, and has
  potential applications in the quantitation of changes in gene copy number
  associated with diseases characterized by such chromosomal alterations.
