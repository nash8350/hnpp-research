  [Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. A contribution to
  the differential diagnosis of multiplex mononeuropathy].
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies could be diagnosed in
  two families. This little-known, dominantly inherited disorder is clinically
  characterised by recurring, spontaneously regressive palsies of peripheral
  nerves, mostly after minimal mechanical compression of the nerve concerned. It
  can be clearly differentiated from mononeuropathies of different pathogenesis
  even in clinically not involved nerves, by means of pathological neurographic
  findings and by the detection of pathognomonic myelinic thickenings in nerve
  biopsies. Prognosis is favourable if recurrences are avoided. This means that
  counselling of the patients and their families is of prophylactic
  significance.
