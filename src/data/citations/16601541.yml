  A rare genetic disorder in the differential diagnosis of the entrapment
  neuropathies hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal-dominant, slowly progressive neuromuscular disorder, which is
  characterized by recurrent acute peripheral nerve palsies.
  Electrophysiological studies show decreased motor and sensory conduction
  velocities in both clinically affected and unaffected nerves. Focal thickening
  of myelin sheath with sausage-like formation, also called tomacula, is seen in
  nerve biopsies. In genetic studies, 1.5-Mb deletion on chromosome 17p11.2 is
  detected in approximately 85% of HNPP cases and point mutations are determined
  in some cases. We describe a 26-year-old man who had a 6-month history of
  paresthesia in the little fingers of his hands. He was diagnosed with HNPP by
  neurologic examination, and electrophysiological and histopathologic studies.
  Studies in his mother and one brother also showed entrapment neuropathy.
  However, no deletions or point mutations were determined in this family. Other
  genetic defects apart from the known ones might be present in this disease.
  The most frequent entrapment syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, is also seen in
  this disease, so physicians dealing with musculoskeletal problems should be
  alert about this subject. Awareness of HNPP may help avoid unnecessary
  operative interventions.
