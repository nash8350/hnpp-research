  Proximal nerve magnetization transfer MRI relates to disability in
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases.
abstract: >-
  The objectives of this study were (1) to develop a novel magnetization
  transfer ratio (MTR) MRI assay of the proximal sciatic nerve (SN), which is
  inaccessible via current tools for assessing peripheral nerves, and (2) to
  evaluate the resulting MTR values as a potential biomarker of myelin content
  changes in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases. MTR was measured
  in the SN of patients with CMT type 1A (CMT1A, n = 10), CMT type 2A (CMT2A, n
  = 3), hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (n = 3), and
  healthy controls (n = 21). Additional patients without a genetically confirmed
  subtype (n = 4), but whose family histories and electrophysiologic tests were
  consistent with CMT, were also included. The relationship between MTR and
  clinical neuropathy scores was assessed, and the interscan and inter-rater
  reliability of MTR was estimated. Mean volumetric MTR values were
  significantly decreased in the SN of patients with CMT1A (33.8 ± 3.3 percent
  units) and CMT2A (31.5 ± 1.9 percent units) relative to controls (37.2 ± 2.3
  percent units). A significant relationship between MTR and disability scores
  was also detected (p = 0.01 for genetically confirmed patients only, p = 0.04
  for all patients). From interscan and inter-rater reliability analyses,
  proximal nerve MTR values were repeatable at the slicewise and mean volumetric
  levels. MTR measurements may be a viable biomarker of proximal nerve pathology
  in patients with CMT.
