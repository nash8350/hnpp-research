  Four children, index cases of families in which autosomal dominant neuropathy
  with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) was diagnosed, are presented. Only
  one child was admitted for evaluation of an acute peroneal palsy, three
  presented with other symptoms. Polyneuropathy was diagnosed in all four
  children, in one of their parents and in some sibs. On inquiry, one child and
  several members of the four families had experienced transient palsies before.
  Morphological studies of the sural nerves showed frequently large tomacula and
  a neuropathic process of segmental de- and remyelination, and axonal
  degeneration. Attention is drawn to the atypical presentation without pressure
  palsies of HNPP.
