  Two buffer PAGE system-based SSCP/HD analysis a general protocol for rapid and
  sensitive mutation screening in cystic fibrosis and any other human genetic
  disease.
abstract: >-
  The large size of many disease genes and the multiplicity of mutations
  complicate the design of an adequate assay for the identification of
  disease-causing variants. One of the most successful methods for mutation
  detection is the single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique. By
  varying temperature, gel composition, ionic strength and additives, we
  optimised the sensitivity of SSCP for all 27 exons of the CFTR gene. Using
  simultaneously SSCP and heteroduplex (HD) analysis, a total of 80 known CF
  mutations (28 missense, 22 frameshift, 17 nonsense, 13 splicesite) and 20
  polymorphisms was analysed resulting in a detection rate of 97.5% including
  the 24 most common mutations worldwide. The ability of this technique to
  detect mutations independent of their nature, frequency, and population
  specificity was confirmed by the identification of five novel mutations
  (420del9, 1199delG, R560S, A613T, T1299I) in Swiss CF patients, as well as by
  the detection of 41 different mutations in 198 patients experimentally
  analysed. We present a three-stage screening strategy allowing analysis of
  seven exons within 5 hours and analysis of the entire coding region within 1
  week, including sequence analysis of the variants. Additionally, our protocol
  represents a general model for point mutation analysis in other genetic
  disorders and has already been successfully established for OTC deficiency,
  collagene deficiency, X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), Duchenne and
  Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD, BMD), Wilson disease (WD), Neurofibromatosis I
  and II, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies, and defects in mitochondrial DNA. No other protocol
  published so far presents standard SSCP/HD conditions for mutation screening
  in different disease genes.
