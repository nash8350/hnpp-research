title: Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for neurological disorders.
abstract: >-
  To determine the extent to which the use of intravenous human immunoglobulin
  for neurological conditions complied with the guidelines of the Australian
  Health Minister's Advisory Council. Patients treated with intravenous
  immunoglobulin in Otago over a 5.5-year period were identified from the
  records of the New Zealand Blood Service and the hospital files were reviewed.
  200 patients received immunoglobulin therapy, of whom 57 had neurological
  conditions myasthenia gravis, (15.8%), Guillain-Barre syndrome (36.8%),
  multiple sclerosis (10.5%), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy
  (17.5%), inclusion body myositis (7%), polymyositis (1.7%), miscellaneous
  disorders (stiff person syndrome, diabetic amyotrophy, neuropathy associated
  with paraproteinaemia, and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies) (10.5). Thirty-one percent of the immunoglobulin was used in 27% of
  the patients for disorders lacking convincing evidence of benefit according to
  the guidelines of the Australian Health Minister's Advisory Council. These
  were multiple sclerosis, inclusion body myositis, and miscellaneous
  neuropathies. Good response occurred most often in patients with myasthenia
  gravis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and chronic inflammatory
  demyelinating polyneuropathy. Intravenous immunoglobulin was frequently used
  for indications not recommended by the Australian Health Minister's Advisory
  Council guidelines. However guidelines vary internationally, and there is a
  paucity of controlled studies to guide management of some uncommon conditions.
