title: Paranodal dysmyelination in peripheral nerves of Trembler mice.
abstract: >-
  Subtle defects in paranodes of myelinated nerve fibers can cause significant
  physiological malfunction. We have investigated myelinated fibers in the
  peripheral nervous system (PNS) of the Trembler mouse, a model of CMT-1A
  neuropathy, for evidence of such defects. Ultrastructural analysis shows that
  the "transverse bands," which attach the myelin sheath to the axon at the
  paranodal axoglial junction, are grossly diminished in number in Trembler
  nerve fibers. Although paranodes often appear to be greatly elongated, it is
  only a short region immediately adjacent to the node of Ranvier that displays
  transverse bands. Where transverse bands are missing, the junctional gap
  widens, thus reducing resistance to short circuiting of nodal action currents
  during saltatory conduction and increasing the likelihood that axonal K(+)
  channels under the myelin sheath will be activated. In addition, we find
  evidence that structural domains in Trembler axons are incompletely
  differentiated, consistent with diminution in nodal Na channel density, which
  could further compromise conduction. Deficiency of transverse bands may also
  increase susceptibility to disruption of the paranodal junction and retraction
  of the myelin sheath. We conclude that Trembler PNS myelinated fibers display
  subtle defects in paranodal and nodal regions that could contribute
  significantly to conduction defects and increased risk of myelin detachment.
