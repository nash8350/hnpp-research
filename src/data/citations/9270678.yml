title: Recurrent polyradiculoneuropathy with the 17p11.2 deletion.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) classically
  occurs as recurrent focal neuropathy. We report the first known instance of
  HNPP manifesting, over a 15-year period, as a recurrent sensorimotor
  polyneuropathy and confirmed by the presence of the PMP-22 gene deletion. We
  suggest that the molecular study of the 17p11.2 region could be an effective
  non invasive investigative tool in cases of chronic recurrent polyneuropathy
  associated with episodes of nerve palsy.
