  Molecular diagnosis of PMP22 gene duplications and deletions comparison of
  different methods.
abstract: >-
  Several techniques can be used to diagnose Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A
  (CMT1A) and hereditary neuro pathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP),
  but no technique combines simplicity with high sensitivity. Multiplex
  ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was applied to develop an
  efficient and sensitive test for the detection of duplication/deletion of the
  peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. The study sample included 70
  probands that had each been previously analysed by fluorescence in situ
  hibridization (FISH) and the restriction fragment length
  polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) assay, both of which detect
  a unique recombination fragment uniquely present in most patients with the
  duplication. A total of nine duplications and 19 deletions were detected in
  the 70 probands using MLPA, and there was 100% concordance between MPLA and
  FISH. A single duplication was missed by the RFLP-PCR assay, which accords
  with the lower sensitivity of this method. It is concluded that the MLPA
  allows accurate detection of PMP22 gene duplications/deletions and could be
  used for the molecular diagnosis of these two neuropathies.
