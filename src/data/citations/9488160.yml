  Absence of mutations in peripheral myelin protein-22, myelin protein zero, and
  connexin 32 in autosomal recessive Dejerine-Sottas syndrome.
abstract: >-
  Motor and sensory neuropathies with the clinical features of HMSN III
  (Dejerine-Sottas syndrome, DSS) are etiologically related to heterozygous
  mutations in either peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22) or myelin protein
  zero (MPZ). Heterozygous mutations in either of these two genes are also
  responsible for other hereditary peripheral neuropathies (HNPP, CMT1A, CMT1B
  or CH). In two families DSS was related to the homozygous presence of a MPZ
  mutation while heterozygosity showed a much milder phenotype. It has therefore
  been suggested that the clinical phenotype in peripheral neuropathies is
  related to the mutated gene, the type of mutation and confounding effects from
  other sources. In this study we describe a family with recessive DSS in which
  mutations were absent from the PMP22, MPZ, and connexin 32 (Cx32) genes. We
  conclude that DSS also exists as a distinct genetic entity with autosomal
  recessive inheritance as originally defined by Dejerine and Sottas in 1893.
