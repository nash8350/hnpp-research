  The first episode of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy
  (HNPP) in childhood is rare. We analyzed retrospectively the data of 7
  patients with a deletion in PMP22 and onset of symptoms before age 18 years.
  Direct sequencing of the LITAF (lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis
  factor) gene was performed in patients and family members. Clinical
  presentations varied from mononeuropathies to brachial plexopathy, with
  recurrent episodes in 4 patients. Electrophysiological abnormalities
  characteristic for HNNP were found in most subjects. Analysis of the LITAF
  gene revealed an Ile92Val polymorphism in 6 of 7 (86%) probands and 5 of 7
  (83%) family members, over 4 times greater frequency than in the general
  population. Clinical suspicion of HNPP even when nerve conduction study
  results do not fulfill HNPP criteria should indicate genetic testing. In our
  patients, early-onset HNPP was associated frequently with isoleucine92valine
  LITAF polymorphism.
