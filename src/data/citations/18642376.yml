  In this study we describe four patients from the same kindred who were
  affected by an autosomal-dominantly inherited peripheral neuropathy. They
  presented an unusual combination of clinical, electrophysiological, and
  pathological findings in association with a new mutation of the PMP22 gene.
  Clinically, three patients had carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms and one patient
  had late-onset peroneal atrophy. Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities
  were reduced without focal slowing at entrapment sites. Nerve biopsy disclosed
  diffuse hypomyelination with focal thickening of the myelin sheath in some
  fibers. Sequence analysis of the PMP22 gene showed a single-nucleotide
  deletion (227delG) in the affected patients. This mutation, which has not been
  reported previously, leads to an open reading frame shift and probably to a
  truncated and unstable PMP22 protein. We conclude that this novel 227delG
  mutation of PMP22 gives a mild form of hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsy with atypical clinical and electrophysiological findings.
