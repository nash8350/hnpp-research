  Electrodiagnostic Characterization of Hereditary Neuropathy With Liability to
  Pressure Palsies.
abstract: >-
  The study objective was electrodiagnostic characterization of a large cohort
  of patients with genetically confirmed hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP). A retrospective review was conducted on all patients
  with HNPP seen at the neuromuscular clinic (London, Canada) from 1977 to 2015.
  Clinical data obtained included patient characteristics, examination findings,
  and nerve conduction study results. A total of 46 patients were analyzed. The
  mean age and median disease duration were 42.6 and 5.0 years, respectively.
  Most patients had abnormalities on sural nerve conduction studies. The most
  common focal neuropathies at compressive sites were ulnar nerve at the elbow
  (85.7%), distal median nerve at the wrist (84.4%), and fibular nerve at the
  fibular head (36.7%). Distal median neuropathy was associated with a mean
  terminal latency of 6.64 milliseconds. The presence of polyneuropathy, median
  terminal motor latency prolongation, and multiple compressive neuropathies are
  the most common findings associated with HNPP.
