  The CMT1A-REP repeat sequence flanks a 1.5 megabase pair (Mb) segment of
  chromosome 17p11.2-12 which is duplicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy
  type 1A (CMT1A) and deleted in hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP). The CMT1A-REP repeat is proposed to mediate
  misalignment and unequal crossover resulting in reciprocal chromosomal
  rearrangements in CMT1A and HNPP. We have constructed a physical map of the
  proximal and distal CMT1A-REP repeats. Cloned fragments from CMT1A-REP repeat
  regions are used to determine the size of the repeats and assess regions of
  homology. The crossover breakpoints were mapped in series of 30 unrelated
  CMT1A patients and 22 unrelated HNPP patients. The CMT1A-REP repeat spans
  approximately 27 kilobase pairs and appears to be continuous. Locations of
  restriction enzyme sites are highly conserved for the proximal and distal
  CMT1A-REP repeats. All crossovers mapped within the CMT1A-REP repeat sequence
  and heterogeneity for breakpoint location demonstrated. Seventy-seven percent
  (40 to 52) of CMT1A and HNPP chromosomes contained breakpoints which mapped
  within a 7.9 kb interval, suggesting the presence of a possible 'hotspot'for
  recombination in CMT1A-REP. DNA sequence analysis for 4 kb of the interval
  containing the majority of crossovers revealed over 98% sequence identity
  between proximal and distal CMT1A-REP repeat sequences. Probes useful for
  molecular-based diagnosis of CMT1A and HNPP are described.
