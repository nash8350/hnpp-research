  Migration of Schwann cells (SCs) progenitors and neurite outgrowth from
  embryonic dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) are two central events during the
  development of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). How these two enthralling
  events preceding myelination are promoted is of great relevance from basic
  research and clinical aspects alike. Recent evidence demonstrates that
  biophysical cues (extracellular matrix stiffness) and biochemical signaling
  act in concert to regulate PNS myelination. Microenvironment stiffness of SCs
  progenitors and embryonic neurites dynamically changes during development. DRG
  explants were isolated from day 12.5 to 13.5 mice embryos and plated on
  laminin-coated substrates with varied stiffness values. After 4 days in
  culture and immunostaining with specific markers, neurite outgrowth pattern,
  SCs progenitors migration, and growth cone shape and advance were analyzed
  with confocal fluorescence microscopy. We found out that growing substrate
  stiffness promotes directional neurite outgrowth, SCs progenitors migration,
  growth cone advance and presumably axons fasciculation. DRG explants are in
  vitro models for the research of PNS development, myelination and
  regeneration. Consequently, we conclude the following Our observations point
  out the importance of mechanosensitivity for the PNS. At the same time, they
  prompt the investigation of the important yet unclear links between PNS
  biomechanics and inherited neuropathies with myelination disorders such as
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1A and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies. Finally, they encourage the consideration of mechanosensitivity in
  bioengineering of scaffolds to aid nerve regeneration after injury.
