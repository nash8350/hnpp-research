  To detect the duplication or deletion of peripheral myelin protein 22(PMP22)
  gene in Chinese patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease(CMT) or hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies(HNPP) using real-time
  quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Duplications or deletions of PMP22
  gene were detected in 113 CMT cases, 4 HNPP cases and 50 normal controls by
  using real-time quantitative PCR. Thirty-six of 113 CMT cases had the PMP22
  duplication, 4 HNPP cases had the PMP22 deletion. No duplication or deletion
  was found in 50 normal controls. The PMP22 duplication rate in Chinese
  patients with CMT is 31.9%(36/113). PMP22 deletion is the common cause of
  HNPP.
