  [Recurrent familial brachial plexopathy as the only clinical expression of
  neuropathy with susceptibility to pressure].
abstract: >-
  We report a family with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP) and chromosome 17p11.2 deletion. This family exhibits a
  peculiar phenotype consisting in recurrent brachial plexopathy episodes. This
  phenotype has to be distinguished from hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy on
  clinical grounds. Although the incidence of brachial plexopathy on HNPP is
  relatively high it is unusual as the sole symptom of the disease. It is
  noteworthy that in the six published families with this peculiar phenotype
  most of the acute episodes became evident after sleep. A greater liability of
  the plexus and a greater vulnerability to mechanical factors during sleep
  hours are the suggested mechanisms to explain this rare clinical onset.
  Recurrent painless brachial plexopathy when associated to generalized
  conduction abnormalities should suggest a HNPP.
