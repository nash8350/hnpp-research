  The objective of this study is to evaluate the nerve ultrasound
  characteristics in genetically distinct inherited neuropathies, the value of
  the modified ultrasound pattern sum score (mUPSS) to differentiate between the
  subtypes and the correlation of ultrasound with nerve conduction studies
  (NCS), disease duration and severity. All patients underwent a standardized
  neurological examination, ultrasound, and NCS. In addition, genetic testing
  was performed. Consequently, mUPSS was applied, which is a sum-score of
  cross-sectional areas (CSA) at predefined anatomical points in different
  nerves. 31 patients were included (10xCharcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT)1a, 3xCMT1b,
  3xCMTX, 9xCMT2, 6xHNPP [Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies]). Generalized, homogeneous nerve enlargement and significantly
  increased UPS scores emphasized the diagnosis of demyelinating neuropathy,
  particularly CMT1a and CMT1b. The amount of enlargement did not depend on
  disease duration, symptom severity, height and weight. In CMTX the nerves were
  enlarged, as well, however, only in the roots and lower limbs, most prominent
  in men. In CMT2 no significant enlargement was detectable. In HNPP the CSA
  values were increased at entrapped sites, and not elsewhere. However, a
  distinction from CMT1, which also showed enlarged CSA values at entrapment
  sites, was only possible by calculating the entrapment ratios and entrapment
  score. The mUPSS allowed distinction between CMT1a (increased UPS scores,
  entrapment ratios <1.0) and HNPP (low UPS scores, entrapment ratios >1.4),
  while CMT1b and CMTX showed intermediate UPS types and entrapment ratios <1.0.
  Although based on few cases, ultrasound revealed consistent and homogeneous
  nerve alteration in certain inherited neuropathies. The modified UPSS is a
  quantitative tool, which may provide useful information for diagnosis,
  differentiation and follow-up evaluation in addition to NCS and molecular
  testing.
