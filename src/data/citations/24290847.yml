  We investigated peripheral nerve function in X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth
  disease type 1 (CMTX1), and considered the functional consequences of mutant
  connexin-32. Twelve subjects (9 female, 3 male) were assessed clinically, by
  nerve conduction and excitability studies. A model of myelinated axon was used
  to clarify the contributing changes. All subjects had abnormal nerve
  conduction. Excitability studies on median nerve axons showed greater
  threshold changes to hyperpolarising currents, with "fanning out" in threshold
  electrotonus, and modest changes in the recovery cycle. Modelling suggested
  shortening of internodal length, increase in nodal fast potassium currents,
  shift of the voltage activation hyperpolarisation-activated
  cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels, and axonal hyperpolarisation. Plotting
  threshold versus extent of hyperpolarising threshold change in threshold
  electrotonus distinguished the CMTX1 patients from other chronic demyelinating
  neuropathies reported in the literature except hereditary neuropathy with
  pressure palsies (HNPP). Some measures of axonal excitability are similar in
  CMTX1 and HNPP (though not the recovery cycle), but they differ from those in
  other chronic demyelinating neuropathies. The findings in CMTX1 are consistent
  with known pathology, but are not correlated to neuropathy severity. The
  findings in CMTX1 could be largely the result of morphological alterations,
  rather than plasticity in channel expression or distribution.
