  A decrease in dietary P, especially in finishing broilers (21 to 38 d old), is
  a crucial issue in poultry production from an environmental and economic point
  of view. Nevertheless, P must be considered together with other dietary
  components such as Ca and microbial phytase. Different corn and soybean
  meal-based diets varying in Ca [low (LCa) 0.37, medium (MCa) 0.57, and high
  (HCa) 0.77%], and nonphytate P [nPP; low (LnPP) 0.18 and high (HnPP) 0.32%]
  content were tested with and without microbial phytase [0 or 500 phytase units
  (FTU)/kg]. Feed intake, BW gain, bone mineralization, and mineral retention
  were examined in 144 Ross PM3 broilers (22 to 38 d old) reared in individual
  cages. Growth performance was not significantly affected by the treatments.
  Nevertheless, a numerical decrease of ADG and ADFI was observed in HCa-LnPP
  and LCa-HnPP associated with an increase of feed conversion ratio. Decreased
  dietary Ca reduced tibia ash content (Ca, linear P < 0.001; quadratic P =
  0.034) and tibia ash weight for the highest level of nPP (Ca × nPP; P =
  0.035). In parallel, increasing dietary Ca reduced the flow of retained P (P =
  0.022) but also tibia ash weight in LnPP diets (Ca × nPP; P = 0.035). The
  responses of the animals in terms of tibia ash content and P retention were
  improved by the addition of microbial phytase especially for the lowest P
  diets (nPP × phytase, P = 0.021 and P = 0.009; respectively). Phytase
  increased dry tibia weight, bone breaking strength, and tibia diameter in
  broilers fed the highest Ca diets (Ca × phytase; P < 0.05). We conclude that
  is possible to decrease P levels in finishing broilers, if the Ca content is
  appropriate. Nevertheless, decreasing the dietary P and Ca cannot allow a
  maximization of bone mineralization, but the optimal threshold remains to be
  determined.
