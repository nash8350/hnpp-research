  We report the clinical, electrophysiological, and pathological findings of two
  unrelated Japanese families with hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP) and confirm the findings of a deletion of peripheral
  myelin protein-22 (PMP-22) gene. Electrophysiological studies revealed slowing
  of nerve conduction velocities of the affected nerves. Sural nerve biopsy
  revealed regions of myelin duplication. The copy numbers of PMP-22 gene was
  lower than that of normal control, suggesting deletion of 17p11.2 including
  PMP-22 gene. Our results indicate that HNPP in these two Japanese families is
  attributable to deletion of 17p11.2 including PMP-22 gene.
