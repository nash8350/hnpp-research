  As the best characterized human genomic disorders, 118 CMT1A and HNPP
  illustrate several common mechanistic features of genomic rearrangements.
  These features include the following (1) Recombination occurs between
  homologous sequences flanking the duplicated/deleted genomic segment. (2) The
  evolution of the mammalian genome may result in an architecture consisting of
  region-specific low-copy repeats that predispose to rearrangement secondary to
  providing homologous regions as substrate for recombination. (3) Strand
  exchange occurs preferentially in a region of perfect sequence identity within
  the flanking repeat sequences. (4) Double-strand breaks likely initiate
  recombination between the flanking repeats. (5) The mechanism and rate of
  homologous recombination resulting in DNA rearrangement may differ for male
  and female gametogenesis. (6) Homologous recombination resulting in DNA
  rearrangement occurs with high frequency in the human genome. (7) Genomic
  disorders result from structural features of the human genome and not
  population specific alleles or founder effects; therefore, genomic disorders
  appear to occur with equal frequencies in different world populations.
