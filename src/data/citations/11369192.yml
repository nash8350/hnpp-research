  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant, demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. Clinical hallmarks
  are recurrent painless focal neuropathies mostly preceded by minor trauma or
  compression at entrapment sites of peripheral nerves. In the majority of the
  patients, HNPP is caused by a 1.5 Mb deletion on chromosome 17p11.2-p12
  containing the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. Point mutations
  within this gene are reported in only a few families. We report a novel
  mutation in the PMP22 gene in a Spanish family with HNPP. The mutation is a 3'
  splice-site mutation, preceding coding exon 3 (c.179-1 G>C), causing a mild
  HNPP phenotype.
