title: '[Hereditary neural amyotrophy (HNA) clinical and molecular genetic basis].'
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA) and hereditary neuropathy with liability
  to pressure palsies (HNPP) are hereditary focal neuropathies. In this study we
  describe three families suffering from HNA. These families were examined
  clinically and electrophysiologically. Linkage analysis with markers from
  distal chromosome 17 was performed in a three-generation family. HNA could be
  separated from HNPP in all three families based on clinical and
  electrophysiological findings. HNA was characterised by recurrent episodes of
  painful brachial plexus lesions. In contrast to HNPP, no evidence for
  generalised neuropathy was found in the HNA families. Linkage analysis
  confirmed the HNA locus on distal chromosome 17. Additionally, we were able to
  refine the HNA locus to a 16 cM region on chromosome 17q24-q25.
