  Genomic disorders have been increasingly recognized as a significant source of
  clinically relevant phenotypes largely fostered by advances in technologies
  for genome-wide analyses. Molecular and clinical studies of copy number
  variants involving chromosome 17 began with locus-specific studies of
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A, OMIM #118220) and hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP, OMIM #162500), which laid
  the foundation for the paradigm of duplication/deletion and gene-dosage for
  our understanding of genomic disorders. With the clinical introduction of
  high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) the number of
  recognized genomic disorders including microduplications has been increasing
  rapidly. A relatively high proportion of disease-associated copy number
  variants map to chromosome 17. This may result from its unique structural
  features, such as relative abundance of segmental duplications and
  interspersed repetitive elements, high gene content, and the presence of
  dosage-sensitive genes. These genomic rearrangements are mediated by diverse
  mechanisms including Non-Allelic Homologous Recombination (NAHR),
  Non-Homologous End-Joining (NHEJ), and Fork Stalling and Template Switching
  (FoSTeS). We provide specific examples of chromosome 17 microduplications with
  the emphasis on their phenotype, specific clinical features aiding in their
  diagnosis, and counseling.
