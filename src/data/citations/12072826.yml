  [Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies study of six Spanish
  families].
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant inherited demyelinating neuropathy typically characterized
  by recurrent episodes of acute painless peripheral nerve palsies often
  preceded by minor trauma or compression at entrapment sites. However, less
  classical phenotypes have been reported. A 1.5 Mb deletion in chromosome 17
  p11.2 has been shown to be the genetic basis of the disease in the majority of
  HNPP patients. The few families without this deletion harbored a mutation in
  the PMP22 gene. We performed a clinical, neurophysiological and molecular
  genetic study of 6 Spanish HNPP families. Five families (22 individuals)
  showed the classical chromosome 17 p11.2 deletion and one family (3
  individuals) had a novel 3'splice-site mutation in PMP22. Neurophysiological
  abnormalities were detected in all symptomatic (n=21) and asymptomatic (n=4)
  deletion or mutation carriers, even in childhood. In addition to the typical
  presentation we observed other phenotypes recurrent focal short-term sensory
  symptoms, a progressive mononeuropathy, a Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT)
  disease-like chronic progressive polyneuropathy, a chronic sensory
  polyneuropathy and a chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. We
  report new or very rare phenotypesThese atypical clinical aspects and
  intrafamilial heterogeneity are present in families with the HNPP deletion as
  well as in the family with the PMP22 mutation. However, the CMT disease-like
  chronic polyneuropathy was more common in the PMP22 mutation family.
  Intrafamilial heterogeneity also seemed to be more pronounced in this kinship.
  Patients in this family had a mild chronic motor and sensory polyneuropathy
  neurophysiologically characterized by delayed distal latencies, reduced nerve
  conduction velocities (NCV) within the demyelinating range, mildly decreased
  amplitudes of motor and sensory evoked potentials and absence of conduction
  blocks. In contrast, patients with the common HNPP deletion, regardless of
  their phenotype, had a diffuse increase in distal motor latencies contrasting
  with moderately reduced motor NCVs, preserved sensory nerve action potentials,
  slowing of NCVs at the common entrapment sites and occasionally conduction
  blocks. In this study we confirm the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of
  HNPP, emphasizing the need for a mutation analysis of the PMP22 gene when the
  common 17p11.2 deletion is not found in clinically suspected HNPP patients. We
  conclude that the 3'splice-site mutation in PMP22 and the common HNPP deletion
  have largely the same functional consequences although some clinical and
  neurophysiological differences were observed.
