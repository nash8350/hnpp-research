  Tomaculous neuropathy has a distinctive pathological pattern of myelin
  thickenings in a high proportion of internodes but no specific pattern of
  nerve degeneration. We have analyzed the variable clinical expression of this
  disorder in a large series of patients. Different phenotypes have been
  recognized the majority of our patients (52 cases) had hereditary neuropathy
  with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) showing wide variability of clinical
  progression and of severity of the single episodes. 3 patients suffered from
  familial recurrent brachial plexus neuropathy (FBPN); 5 patients had a
  symmetrical progressive sensorimotor involvement of the limbs (SSMN),
  predominantly in the distal portions and leading to permanent disability. The
  explanation for this clinical variability does not emerge from our data or
  from the literature. Segmental demyelination is the major change correlating
  with the episodes of nerve palsy; axonal degeneration might be rarely
  associated. The myelin sausages are the markers of a selective vulnerability
  of the nerve fibers either to mechanical injury or to some other unknown
  event.
