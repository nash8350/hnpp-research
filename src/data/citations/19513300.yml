title: A Family Harboring CMT1A Duplication and HNPP Deletion.
abstract: >-
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) is associated with duplication of
  chromosome 17p11.2-p12, whereas hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP), which is an autosomal dominant neuropathy showing
  characteristics of recurrent pressure palsies, is associated with 17p11.2-p12
  deletion. An altered gene dosage of PMP22 is believed to the main cause
  underlying the CMT1A and HNPP phenotypes. Although CMT1A and HNPP are
  associated with the same locus, there has been no report of these two
  mutations within a single family. We report a rare family harboring CMT1A
  duplication and HNPP deletion.
