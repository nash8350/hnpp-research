  A 16-year-old girl with a typical features of hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) and deletion on chromosome 17p11.2 was
  described. In the mother who was asymptomatic the same genetic defect was
  found. In a sural nerve biopsy obtained from the girl myelin thickenings
  characteristic for this disease and de- and remyelination in nerve fibers were
  found. Special attention was paid to the occurrence of uncompacted myelin,
  which was present in diffuse and focal forms. It is concluded that high amount
  of uncompacted myelin is characteristic for HNPP and it is probably related to
  the under-expression of peripheral myelin protein 22.
