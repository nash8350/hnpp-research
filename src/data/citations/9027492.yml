  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) is associated with a 1.5-Mb tandem
  DNA duplication in chromosome 17p11.2-p12, while hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is associated with a 1.5-Mb deletion at
  this locus. The 1.5-Mb CMT1A monomer unit duplicated in CMT1A and deleted in
  HNPP is flanked by low-copy repeats termed CMT1A-REPs. Both diseases appear to
  be caused by an altered copy number of the peripheral myelin protein 22 gene
  (PMP22), which lies within the critical region. To identify additional genes
  rapidly, we used a cosmid contig of this region and reciprocal probing of
  arrayed chromosome 17-specific cosmid and cDNA libraries. Three cDNA clones
  were identified within the CMT1A duplication/HNPP deletion region and one just
  proximal to the critical region. The cDNA for human heme Afarnesyltransferase
  (COX10) mapped 10 kb centromeric to the distal CMT1A-REP. The other two cDNA
  clones from within the critical interval mapped to cosmid 126D1 at the mfd41
  (D17S261) DNA marker, and their conceptual translation showed homology to 60S
  ribosomal protein L9 (RPL9) and chromosomal protein RMSA-1 (RMSA-1). A gene
  that is homologous to human peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha
  (hPPARA) was identified near the proximal CMT1A-REP.
