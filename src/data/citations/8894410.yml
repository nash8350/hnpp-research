  Deletion of the PMP22 gene and hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies.
abstract: >-
  Deletion of the 1.5 Mb tract on chromosome 17p11.2-12 that is duplicated in
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A is commonly associated with hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. The deletion, which originates
  from an unequal meiotic crossover involving two homologous repeats, causes
  underexpression of the peripheral myelin protein gene PMP22. PMP22 frameshift
  and non-sense mutations can be found in the rare nondeleted cases. Targeted
  disruption of the PMP22 gene in mice has provided an animal model for the
  disease. Current studies are aimed at characterising the genetics of this
  chromosomal rearrangement and the pathogenic role of altered PMP22 expression.
