  Maternal Bilateral Radial Neuropathy During Childbirth in Hereditary
  Neuropathy With a Predisposition to Pressure Palsies (HNPP).
abstract: >-
  A 30-year-old woman developed severe bilateral radial neuropathies during
  vaginal delivery of twins, likely secondary to positioning and muscular
  effort. Subsequent evaluation led to the diagnosis of hereditary neuropathy
  with predisposition to pressure palsies. Avoidance of prolonged muscular
  effort in the arms in conjunction with medial intervention to shorten the
  second stage of labor may help prevent debilitating radial nerve injury in
  women with this disorder.
