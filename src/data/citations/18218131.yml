  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal-dominant painless peripheral neuropathy characterized by episodes of
  repeated focal pressure neuropathies at sites of entrapment/compression, with
  a considerable variability in the clinical course. Electrodiagnostic and
  genetic testing are important in the diagnostic evaluation of these patients.
  We report an unusual HNPP phenotype, five compression neuropathies in four
  nerves in a patient with bilateral hand numbness. A 42-year-old female,
  presented with acute bilateral paresthesias and weakness in her hands after
  starting yoga exercises requiring hyperextension of her hands at the wrists.
  Her presentation was complicated by a) a remote history of acute onset foot
  drop and subsequent improvement, b) previous diagnoses of demyelinating
  peripheral neuropathy, possibly Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and c) exposure
  to leprosy. Electrodiagnostic testing showed 5 separate compression
  neuropathies in 4 nerves including severe left and right ulnar neuropathies at
  the wrist, left and right median neuropathies at the wrist and left ulnar
  neuropathy at the elbow. There was a mild generalized, primarily
  demyelinating, peripheral polyneuropathy. Based on the clinical suspicion and
  electrodiagnostic findings, consistent with profound demyelination in areas of
  compression, genetic analysis was done which identified a deletion of the
  PMP-22 gene consistent with HNPP. HNPP can present with unusual phenotypes,
  such as 5 separate mononeuropathies, bilateral ulnar and median neuropathies
  at the wrists and ulnar neuropathy at the elbow with mild peripheral
  demyelinating polyneuropathy associated with the PMP-22 gene deletion.
