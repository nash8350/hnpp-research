  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1) and hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are the most frequent autosomal
  dominantly inherited disorders of the peripheral nervous system. The recessive
  inheritance is observed only exceptionally. Unequal crossing-over of
  misaligned flanking CMT1A-REP elements on chromosome 17p11.2 is the most
  frequent cause of the CMT1A duplication and of the reciprocal deletion in HNPP
  patients. Recently a recombination was noted. In our study 71 Slovene CMT1
  patients from 36 families, 12 HNPP patients from 6 families and their 31
  healthy relatives were analysed for the presence of these recombination
  mutations. In 29 of 36 unrelated CMT1 (81%) and in all 6 unrelated HNPP
  patients the duplication or the deletion, on chromosome 17p11.2-12 was
  detected. In 26 out of 29 duplication patients (CMT1A) (90%) a 3.2 kb
  EcoRI/SacI duplication junction fragment was observed. The analogous 7.8 kb
  EcoRI/EcoRI deletion junction fragment was found in 4 out of 6 unrelated HNPP
  deletion patients (67%). Overall we found a recombination mutation inside the
  in 86% of unrelated Slovene CMT1A and HNPP patients. One hundred and
  thirty-six DNA samples of the CMT1 and HNPP patients and of the healthy
  controls were negative for the potentially recessive Thr118Met PMP22 amino
  acid substitution. Dominantly inherited CMT1A duplications and HNPP deletions
  on chromosome 17p11.2 are thus, as in most other European countries, the most
  common mutations in Slovene CMT1 and HNPP patients. No signs of polymorphism
  or of potentially recessive mutation were found at the specific Thr118Met
  PMP22 site.
