  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is an autosomal
  dominant peripheral neuropathy characterized by compressive focal neuropathies
  and an underlying sensorimotor demyelinative polyneuropathy. It is usually
  caused by a 1.5 Mb deletion of the PMP22 gene (17p11.2). We describe the case
  of a 31 year-old woman who presented with acute demyelinative peripheral
  polyneuropathy affecting the four limbs and elevated cerebrospinal fluid
  protein content a few days after a viral illness. Acute inflammatory
  demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP, Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome) was suspected.
  However, electrophysiologic examination suggested HNPP and subsequent genetic
  testing was confirmatory. This case demonstrates that HNPP can present in an
  acute manner, mimicking AIDP.
