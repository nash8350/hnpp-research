title: Entrapment syndrome of multiple nerves in graft-versus-host disease.
abstract: >-
  Peripheral nerve entrapment syndromes are associated with hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies and a variety of rheumatic and
  endocrinological diseases. We report a patient with entrapment syndromes of
  multiple nerves associated with chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) after
  allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Nerve ultrasound,
  histology, and ultrastructural changes were assessed. The 51-year-old man had
  developed severe deep dermal sclerosis due to chronic GVHD with a progressive
  polyneuropathy and entrapment syndromes of multiple nerves. Pre-stenotic
  enlargement was shown by nerve ultrasound. Histology demonstrated fibrosis of
  the epineurium with scarce infiltration of macrophages. Electron microscopy
  demonstrated alterations of the myelin sheaths and marked depletion of
  normal-sized myelinated nerve fibers. In addition to polyneuropathy, chronic
  GVHD can be associated with peripheral nerve entrapment syndromes and should
  be added to the differential diagnosis of compressive neuropathies.
