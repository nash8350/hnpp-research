  The genetic defect responsible for hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsy (HNPP) is located in the same segment that is duplicated in
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A). HNPP had been presumed to be rare until
  an epidemiological study found a much higher incidence than was expected; the
  researchers suggested that HNPP was underrecognized because many affected
  persons have mild symptoms. We believe that another reason for underdiagnosis
  of HNPP is the marked phenotypic variability of the disease. We recommend,
  therefore, that DNA analysis for the 17p11.2 deletion be considered in
  patients with unexplained demyelinating neuropathy regardless of family
  history.
