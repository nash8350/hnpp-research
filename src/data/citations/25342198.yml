  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) represent the most common heritable
  neuromuscular disorders. Molecular diagnostics of CMT1A/HNPP diseases confirm
  clinical diagnosis, but their value is limited to the clinical course and
  prognosis. However, no biomarkers of CMT1A/HNPP have been identified. We
  decided to explore if the LITAF/SIMPLE gene shared a functional link to the
  PMP22 gene, whose duplication or deletion results in CMT1A and HNPP,
  respectively. By studying a large cohort of CMT1A/HNPP-affected patients, we
  found that the LITAF I92V sequence variant predisposes patients to an earlier
  age of onset of both the CMT1A and HNPP diseases. Using cell transfection
  experiments, we showed that the LITAF I92V sequence variant partially
  mislocalizes to the mitochondria in contrast to wild-type LITAF which
  localizes to the late endosome/lysosomes and is associated with a tendency for
  PMP22 to accumulate in the cells. Overall, this study shows that the I92V
  LITAF sequence variant would be a good candidate for a biomarker in the case
  of the CMT1A/HNPP disorders.
