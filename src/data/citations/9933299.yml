title: >-
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A and hereditary neuropathy with liability
  to pressure palsies a SacI polymorphism in the proximal CMT1A-REP elements may
  lead to genetic misdiagnosis.
abstract: >-
  A male patient with clinical signs and symptoms of a demyelinating neuropathy
  was shown to have a duplication of the 1.5-Mb region on chromosome 17p11.2 by
  means of two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). This duplication
  is typical for the vast majority of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) cases.
  Analysis of DNA extracted from peripheral blood used to detect an EcoRI/SacI
  3. 2-kb junction fragment with probe pLR7.8 confirmed the CMT1A duplication,
  but also revealed a 7.8-kb fragment usually observed in patients with a
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). Both
  fragments observed in one patient canot result from one unequal crossover. In
  EcoRI/SacI Southern hybridization experiments with probe pLR7.8 DNA of his
  healthy parents also revealed a 7.8-kB restriction fragment. A subsequent
  two-color FISH analysis, however, indicated a normal status for interphase
  nuclei of the parents. Hence we hypothesize that the 7.8-kb fragment observed
  in our patient and his parents is not the product of unequal crossover during
  meiosis but due to a polymorphism of the SacI site in a proximal CMT1A-REP
  element.
