  Neuropathic scapuloperoneal syndrome (Davidenkow's syndrome) with chromosome
  17p11.2 deletion.
abstract: >-
  The nosologic boundary of neuropathic scapuloperoneal syndrome (Davidenkow's
  syndrome) remains ill defined and its genetic basis is unknown. A case of
  Davidenkow's syndrome with the monochromosomic 17p11.2 deletion that often is
  associated with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  (HNPP) is described. The other allele at chromosome 17p11.2 locus was of
  normal length, and direct sequencing of the coding region of the peripheral
  nerve protein-22 gene in this allele revealed no additional mutation. The
  deleted allele in the proband was inherited from the paternal line in which
  the affected members had a late onset Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 clinical
  phenotype. This observation suggests that the rare Davidenkow's syndrome is
  clinically related to HNPP and its genotype could be a chromosome 17p11.2
  deletion.
