  In hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), the
  increase in distal motor latencies (DMLs) is often out of proportion to the
  slowing of conduction velocities, but the pathophysiological mechanism is
  still unclear. We used a combined electrophysiological and ultrasonographic
  (US) approach to provide insight into this issue. Twelve HNPP subjects
  underwent extensive electrophysiological studies and US measurements of the
  cross-sectional area (CSA) of several peripheral nerves. US nerve enlargement
  was only observed in the carpal tunnel, Guyon's canal, the elbow and the
  fibular head. We did not observe US abnormalities at sites where nerve
  entrapment is uncommon. An increase in DMLs was observed regardless of US
  nerve enlargement. The increased nerve CSA only in common sites of entrapment
  likely reflected the well-documented nerve vulnerability to mechanical stress
  in HNPP. No morphometric changes were seen in the distal nerve segments where
  compression/entrapment is unlikely, despite the fact that the DMLs were
  increased. These data suggest that factors other than mechanical stress are
  responsible for the distal slowing of action potential propagation. We
  speculate that a mixture of mechanical insults and an axon-initiated process
  in the distal nerves underlies the distal slowing and/or conduction failure in
  HNPP.
