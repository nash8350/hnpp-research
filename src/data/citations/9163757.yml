  The crossover breakpoints for hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP) are located in the CMT 1 A-REP repeat flanking a 1.5 Mb region
  of chromosome 17p11.2-12. Three-unrelated HNPP patients have breakpoints in a
  3.2 kb novel fragment of recombinant chromosome in the CMT 1 A-REP repeat. The
  fragment is detected by recombinant chromosome-specific polymerase chain
  reaction (PCR). Further analysis of PCR demonstrated a 1.2 kb novel junction
  fragment in the 3.2 kb region in all HNPP patients. The precise mapping of the
  breakpoints indicated that 2 patients were localized in a 700 bp interval of
  the 1.2 kb fragment 1.3kb telomeric to a marier transposon-like element
  (Kiyosawa and Chance, HMG 5 745-753, 1996), suggesting that this region is a
  recombinational "hotspot" within the CMT 1 A-REP repeat for HNPP as well as
  CMT 1 A.
