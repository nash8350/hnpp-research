  [Tomaculous neuropathy. A histopathological study and electroclinical
  correlates in 10 cases].
abstract: >-
  Among 980 sural nerve biopsies, the nerves of 10 patients showed a great
  number of focal sausage-shaped thickenings of the myelin sheaths and were
  investigated by light and electron microscopy, teasing and quantitative
  studies. Single teased nerve fibres revealed myelin thickening in more than 25
  p. 100 of internodes. This condition defined the tomaculous neuropathy and
  differed from other degenerative or toxic neuropathies which displayed a small
  number of internodes with myelin thickenings, in less than 5 p. 100. Segmental
  demyelination and remyelination were found in 12 p. 100 to 65 p. 100 of
  myelinated fibres. Tomaculous swellings were observed in the internodes of
  these fibres. Except axonal constriction within the sausage-shaped
  thickenings, no fibers with axonal degeneration was observed. The density of
  myelinated and unmyelinated fibres was normal. The loss of large myelinated
  fibres was interpreted as resulting from the myelinic changes. Clinical and
  electrophysiological data were similar in the ten cases of tomaculous
  neuropathies and in hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies,
  i.e. autosomal dominant inheritance, higher incidence in males, recurrent
  nerve trunck and/or brachial plexus involvement related to compression,
  slowing of nerve conduction velocities in clinically affected and unaffected
  nerves more pronounced in anatomical narrow sites and increased F wave
  latencies. One patient (case 10) showed a mixed sensory motor progressive
  neuropathy but signs of widespread neuropathy were noted in more advanced
  cases. A great number of tomaculous swellings of myelin sheaths is considered
  as a specific but non constant change of hereditary neuropathy with liability
  to pressure palsies.
