  DNA analysis in Finnish patients with hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP).
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is a
  dominantly inherited disorder that presents as recurrent mononeuropathies
  precipitated by apparently trivial traumas. The presence of a deletion in
  17p11.2 was analysed in 13 Finnish families with HNPP. The deletion was found
  in all patients who were neurologically and neurophysiologically confirmed to
  have HNPP. In the problematic cases the detection of the gene defect is the
  method of choice in the diagnosis of HNPP. Analysis of DNA can also be used to
  detect clinically unaffected family members.
