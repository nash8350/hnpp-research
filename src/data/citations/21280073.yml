  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) affects 1 in 2,500 people and is caused by
  mutations in more than 30 genes. Identifying the genetic cause of CMT is often
  necessary for family planning, natural history studies, and for entry into
  clinical trials. However genetic testing can be both expensive and confusing
  to patients and physicians. We analyzed data from 1,024 of our patients to
  determine the percentage and features of each CMT subtype within this clinic
  population. We identified distinguishing clinical and physiological features
  of the subtypes that could be used to direct genetic testing for patients with
  CMT. Of 1,024 patients evaluated, 787 received CMT diagnoses. A total of 527
  patients with CMT (67%) received a genetic subtype, while 260 did not have a
  mutation identified. The most common CMT subtypes were CMT1A, CMT1X,
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), CMT1B, and
  CMT2A. All other subtypes accounted for less than 1% each. Eleven patients had
  >1 genetically identified subtype of CMT. Patients with genetically identified
  CMT were separable into specific groups based on age of onset and the degree
  of slowing of motor nerve conduction velocities. Combining features of the
  phenotypic and physiology groups allowed us to identify patients who were
  highly likely to have specific subtypes of CMT. Based on these results, we
  propose a strategy of focused genetic testing for CMT, illustrated in a series
  of flow diagrams created as testing guides.
