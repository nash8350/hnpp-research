  Pain in hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy an association
  with fibromyalgia syndrome?
abstract: >-
  This study characterizes the nature of pain in hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsy (HNPP). This retrospective study was performed to
  assess duration, nature, location, and intensity of pain on initial
  presentation of subjects with HNPP, including the degree and type of analgesic
  medication use and electrodiagnostic characteristics. Subjects who met the
  American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) were
  also identified. Of 32 HNPP subjects, 24 (75%) had symptoms of pain, and 4
  (12%) had pain as an initial symptom. Of subjects who described pain, 9 (28%)
  reported only musculoskeletal pain, 10 (31%) only neuropathic pain, and 5
  (16%) both musculoskeletal and neuropathic pain. All 9 subjects with only
  musculoskeletal pain met criteria for FMS. Neuropathic and musculoskeletal
  pain occur commonly in HNPP and may be a presenting symptom. Additionally,
  HNPP with predominantly musculoskeletal pain may meet criteria for FMS and
  potentially delay the diagnosis.
