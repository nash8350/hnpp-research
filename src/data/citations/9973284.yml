  Disorders known to be caused by molecular and cytogenetic abnormalities of the
  proximal short arm of chromosome 17 include Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type
  1A (CMT1A), hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP),
  Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), and mental retardation and congenital anomalies
  associated with partial duplication of 17p. We identified a patient with
  multifocal mononeuropathies and mild distal neuropathy, growth hormone
  deficiency, and mild mental retardation who was found to have a duplication of
  the SMS region of 17p11.2 and a deletion of the peripheral myelin protein 22
  (PMP22) gene within 17p12 on the homologous chromosome. Further molecular
  analyses reveal that the dup(17)(p11.2p11.2) is a de novo event but that the
  PMP22 deletion is familial. The family members with deletions of PMP22 have
  abnormalities indicative of carpal tunnel syndrome, documented by
  electrophysiological studies prior to molecular analysis. The chromosomal
  duplication was shown by interphase FISH analysis to be a tandem duplication.
  These data indicate that familial entrapment neuropathies, such as carpal
  tunnel syndrome and focal ulnar neuropathy syndrome, can occur because of
  deletions of the PMP22 gene. The co-occurrence of the 17p11.2 duplication and
  the PMP22 deletion in this patient likely reflects the relatively high
  frequency at which these abnormalities arise and the underlying molecular
  characteristics of the genome in this region.
