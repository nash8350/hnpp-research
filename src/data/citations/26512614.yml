  The majority of previous studies on hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP) were focused on peripheral nerves, whereas cerebral
  alterations in HNPP have been less attended to. In this work, Diffusion tensor
  imaging (DTI) was used to detect the changes in WM, especially in the
  normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in HNPP patients for its sensitivity in
  probing the microstructure of WM, the sensitive metric was searched for
  probing cerebral alterations and the regional distribution of cerebral
  abnormalities was identified. Twelve HNPP patients and 12 age- and
  gender-matched healthy controls underwent the conventional MRI, DTI scan, and
  electrophysiological examination. The conventional MRI images were first
  analyzed to identify abnormal intense regions and the NAWM regions. NAWM
  refers to the white matter regions that do not include the lesions on
  conventional MRI. The apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy
  (FA) values of the NAWM were then measured and compared between patient and
  control groups. The sensitivity and specificity of 3 methods and the cerebral
  regional distribution of MR signal abnormalities were further analyzed.
  Hyperintense foci were observed on T2 weighted image and fluid attenuated
  inversion recovery images in 6 patients. Compared to the controls, FA values
  of the patients were significantly lower in bilateral frontal, orbitofrontal,
  and temporal NAWMs; whereas the electrophysiological examination results of
  patients and controls exhibited no statistically significant difference. The
  sensitivity of FA value was higher than that of electrophysiological
  examination and conventional MRI. The majority of abnormal signals on
  conventional MRI images and abnormal FA values were located in the frontal and
  temporal lobes. The results of our study show cerebral WM changes in HNPP
  patients. FA value in DTI has been shown to be sensitive to the cerebral
  microstructural changes in HNPP. The frontal lobe is the predilection site
  that is most involved in HNPP.
