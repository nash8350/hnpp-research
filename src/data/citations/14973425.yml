  The clinical approach to hereditary neuropathies of adulthood has become very
  complex. The following issues are reviewed elements that point to a neuropathy
  of inherited origin, different modalities of presentation, laboratory and
  instrumental diagnostic tests, including molecular tests, symptoms and signs
  of involvement of other organs. It is useful to identify different phenotypes
  according to disease course; involvement of motor, sensory, autonomic fibres;
  site of lesion (neuropathy versus neuronopathy); calibre of involved fibres
  (small-fibre versus large-fibre neuropathy); presence of distinctive symptoms
  (neuropathic pain); involvement of other organs or apparatus.
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP),
  hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy, Fabry disease, Tangier disease,
  porphyric neuropathies, Refsum disease, hereditary neuropathy with liability
  to pressure palsies (HNPP), hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy and other rare
  disorders involving the peripheral nervous system are reviewed.
