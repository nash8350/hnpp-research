  The objectives of this study were to evaluate the clinical and
  electrophysiological findings in peroneal mononeuropathies following a
  weight-reduction diet. Thirty patients with acute peroneal palsy and weight
  loss were studied. Complete nerve conduction studies (NCS) were performed in
  upper and lower limbs. NCS showed conduction block (CB) of the peroneal nerve
  at the fibular head that recovered in 29 patients within 3 weeks to 3 months.
  Severity of CB was correlated with clinical weakness. Three patients had
  abnormalities consistent with polyneuropathy (PNP). NCS in asymptomatic
  relatives confirmed familial neuropathy. Nerve biopsy and molecular study were
  consistent with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  (HNPP). One of these peroneal palsies (6 months) recovered after neurolysis.
  Weight loss might be a risk factor in peroneal mononeuropathies. NCS is a tool
  in the diagnosis of the site and severity of the nerve injury. Testing should
  be considered for relatives of patients with PNP because peroneal
  mononeuropathies may be the first expression of HNPP.
