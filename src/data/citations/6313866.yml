  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (NLPP) is a rare
  disease characterized by recurrent sensory-motor deficits precipitated by
  exposure to minor pressure. This report describes a variant of this neuropathy
  in 5 siblings suffering from painful palsies after strenuous work with
  concurrent episodes of abdominal colic resembling that of acute intermittent
  porphyria. Electrophysiological studies of the index case showed the typical
  abnormalities of motor and sensory nerve conduction, including clinically
  non-affected nerves. Light and electron-microscopic examination showed the
  characteristic lesions of the NLPP with sausage-like swelling of the myelin
  sheaths. In addition, non-compacted, "loose" myelin lamellae were frequently
  observed in association with distended Schmidt-Lantermann incisures.
  Non-compacted myelin was a prominent finding in this type of demyelinating
  neuropathy. We suggest that an unknown metabolic factor may induce both
  demyelination of peripheral nerve fibers and functional disturbance in
  autonomic nerves leading to attacks of abdominal pain.
