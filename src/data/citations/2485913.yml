title: Two cases of Dandy-Walker syndrome and chronic polyneuropathy.
abstract: >-
  The paper describes a so far unreported combination of Dandy-Walker syndrome
  and chronic hereditary polyneuropathy in 2 boys. One of the boys has a de- and
  remyelinating motor and sensory polyneuropathy, with either an autosomal
  recessive mode of inheritence or a sporadic occurrence. The other has an
  autosomal dominant form of mild polyneuropathy with tomaculum formations in
  myelinated fibers, corresponding to hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies.
