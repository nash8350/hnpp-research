title: Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies in infancy.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is an
  autosomal-dominant disorder, classically characterized by recurrent
  mononeuropathies, associated with a deletion at 17p11.2, encompassing the
  peripheral myelin protein 22 gene. The typical clinical episodes of pressure
  palsy are usually noted for the first time during the 2nd or 3rd decade of
  life. We found only few reports in prepubertal children. We report a case of a
  7.5-year-old child with muscle weakness and severe hypotonia associated with
  developmental gross motor delay. We suspect that bilateral peroneal nerve
  palsies after birth were the first episode of pressure palsy. Nerve conduction
  studies demonstrated slightly prolonged distal latencies with normal
  conduction velocity. Typical features of hereditary neuropathy with liability
  to pressure palsies with recurrent mononeuropathies were found in the father.
  DNA analysis revealed 1.5-Mb deletion at 17p11.2 in both father and child. To
  the best of our knowledge, this patient is one of the youngest ever found with
  this disease.
