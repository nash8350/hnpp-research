abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent transient pressure
  palsies of peripheral nerves and slowing of nerve conduction velocity of the
  peripheral nerves at common sites of compression. In most cases the molecular
  basis of the disease is a 1.5 Mb deletion on chromosome 17p11.2. We report
  four members of a family with different clinical phenotypes.
  Electrophysiological and genetic studies were consistent with the diagnosis of
  HNPP. Nerve biopsy is only necessary in patients with a normal result of the
  molecular genetic analysis. The variability of the clinical phenotype along
  with asymptomatic individuals could account for an under-recognition of this
  inherited neuropathy.
