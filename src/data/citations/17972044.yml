title: Saturday night brachial plexus palsy.
abstract: >-
  An unusual case of brachial plexopathy following an alcohol binge is
  presented. The patient developed numbness and weakness of his right hand and
  neurophysiological tests demonstrated that the lesion level was at the
  brachial plexus. MRI of the brachial plexus, cerebrospinal fluid examination
  and DNA analysis for hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  were normal. Repeated neurological examination and neurophysiological studies
  60 days later were normal. A diagnosis of brachial plexus neuropathy
  consequent to non-traumatic stretching of the middle and the lower trunks was
  made.
