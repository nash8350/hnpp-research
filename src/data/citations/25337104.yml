  We used the allele-specific PCR-double digestion method on peripheral myelin
  protein 22 (PMP22) to determine duplication and deletion mutations in the
  proband and family members of one family with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type
  1 and one family with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies. The proband and one subclinical family member from the
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 family had a PMP22 gene duplication; one
  patient from the hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  family had a PMP22 gene deletion. Electron microscopic analysis of ultrathin
  sections of the superficial peroneal nerve from the two probands demonstrated
  demyelination and myelin sheath hyperplasia, as well as an 'onion-like'
  structure in the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A patient. We observed an
  irregular thickened myelin sheath and 'mouse-nibbled'-like changes in the
  patient with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. In the
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A patient, nerve electrophysiological
  examination revealed moderate-to-severe reductions in the motor and sensory
  conduction velocities of the bilateral median nerve, ulnar nerve, tibial
  nerve, and sural nerve. Moreover, the compound muscle action potential
  amplitude was decreased. In the patient with hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies, the nerve conduction velocity of the bilateral
  tibial nerve and sural nerve was moderately reduced, and the nerve conduction
  velocity of the median nerve and ulnar nerve of both upper extremities was
  slightly reduced.
