  Cell migration within the embryonic limb primordium of Drosophila as revealed
  by a novel fluorescence method to visualize mRNA and protein.
abstract: >-
  We report a new technique using fluorescent probes to detect a mRNA and a
  protein simultaneously in the Drosophila embryo. For in situ hybridization,
  3-hydroxy-N-2'-biphenyl-2-naphthalenecarboxamide phosphate ester (HNPP)/Fast
  Red TR was used as a fluorescent substrate for alkaline phosphatase. It was
  possible to compare protein and mRNA expression on a cell by cell basis with a
  laser scanning confocal microscope. We applied this technique to analyse the
  dynamics of Distal-less (Dll) enhancer activity in the thoracic limb
  primordium in the early Drosophila embryo. We stained embryos bearing the Dll
  early enhancer (Dll-304) fused to the Escherichia coli lacZ gene. LacZ mRNA
  was detectable in the ventral region of the limb primordium, and
  Î²-galactosidase protein in the dorsal region. In the middle, both mRNA and
  protein were detectable. These results suggest that the Dll enhancer is
  activated in the ventral region of the limb primordium and that Dll-positive
  cells migrate from a ventral position to a dorsal one within a single limb
  primordium.
