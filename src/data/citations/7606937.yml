  Simultaneous visualization of Q-bands and FISH signals using a novel
  fluorochrome.
abstract: >-
  We developed a new HNPP-azo dye method for detection of fluorescence in situ
  hybridization (FISH) signals on Q-banded chromosomes by use of a newly
  synthesized fluorochrome, HNPP
  (3-hydroxy-N-2'-biphenyl-2-naphthalenecarboxamide phosphate ester), which
  reacts enzymatically with alkaline phosphatase and azo dye. The FISH staining
  method permits simultaneous detection of orange HNPP signals on chromosomal
  sites labeled by Q-banding, allowing the assignment of small (440-1,200 bp)
  probes.
