  The spectrum of clinical and electrophysiological features in hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is broad. We analyze a
  series of Brazilian patients with HNPP. Correlations between clinical
  manifestations, laboratory features, electrophysiological analyze,
  histological and molecular findings were done. In five cases, more than one
  episode occurred before diagnosis. Median nerve in the carpal tunnel at the
  wrist, ulnar nerve in its groove at the elbow, fibular nerve in the head of
  the fibula at the knee, radial nerve in its groove of the humerus and
  suprascapular nerve in its notch at the supraspinous fossa were found as focal
  neuropathies. One patient presented with persistent writer's cramp after ulnar
  nerve palsy. Nerve conduction studies showed focal neuropathy in all patients
  and concomitant generalized symmetrical neuropathy in eight patients.
  Molecular analysis of thegene detected deletion of the 1.5-Mb fragment in all
  patients.
