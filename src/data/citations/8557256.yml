abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is in most
  cases associated with an interstitial deletion of the same 1.5-Mb region at
  17p11.2 that is duplicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) patients.
  Unequal crossing-over following misalignment at flanking repeat sequences
  (CMT1A-REP), either leads to tandem duplication in CMT1A patients or deletion
  in HNPP patients. With the use of polymorphic DNA markers located within the
  CMT1A/HNPP duplication/deletion region we detected the HNPP deletion in 16
  unrelated HNPP patients, 11 of Belgian and 5 of French origin. In all cases,
  the 1.5-Mb size of the HNPP deletion was confirmed by EcoRI dosage analysis
  using a CMT1A-REP probe. In the 16 HNPP patients, the same 370/320-kb EagI
  deletion-junction fragments were detected with pulsed field gel
  electrophoresis (PFGE), while in CMT1A patients, a 150-kb EagI
  duplication-junction fragment was seen. Thus, PFGE analysis of EagI-digested
  DNA with a CMT1A-REP probe allows direct detection of the HNPP deletion or the
  CMT1A duplication for DNA diagnostic purposes.
