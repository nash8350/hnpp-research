  Congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy appears early in life, resulting in a
  delay of motor and sensory development. Mutations involve genes such as myelin
  protein zero (MPZ), peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22), and early growth
  response 2 (EGR2). We present a patient with two compound mutations in PMP22 a
  point mutation causing a premature STOP codon in exon 3 was inherited from the
  mother on the first allele, and the "typical" PMP22 deletion in the
  17p11.2-p12 region was inherited from the father on the other allele. A sural
  biopsy was performed at age four. The patient has been followed from 28 months
  to 21 years of age; he presented significant sensory disturbances, with a
  slight motor deficit. PMP22 mRNA quantitation showed a severe decrease of
  PMP22 protein. No myelin sheaths were observed in the biopsy; mesaxons failed
  to form. The absence of PMP22 provides new insights into the role of this
  protein.
