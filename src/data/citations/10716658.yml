title: Inherited peripheral neuropathy.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary disorders of the peripheral nerves constitute a group of frequently
  encountered neurological diseases. Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 1
  (CMT1) is genetically heterogeneous and characterized by demyelination with
  moderately to severely reduced nerve conduction velocities, absent muscle
  stretch reflexes and onion bulb formation. Genetic loci for CMT1 map to
  chromosome 17 (CMT1A), chromosome 1 (CMT1B), and another unknown autosome
  (CMT1C). CMT1A is most often associated with a tandem 1.5-megabase (Mb)
  duplication in chromosome 17p11.2-12, or in rare patients may result from a
  point mutation in the peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22) gene. CMT1 B result
  from point mutations in the myelin protein zero (Po or MPZ) gene. The
  molecular defect in CMT1 C is unknown. Mutations in the early growth response
  2 gene (EGR2) are also associated with demyelinating neuropathy. Other rare
  forms of demyelinating peripheral neuropathies map to chromosome 8q, 10q, and
  11q. X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMTX), which has clinical
  features similar to CMT1, is associated with mutations in the connexin32 gene.
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 2 (CMT2) is characterized by normal or
  mildly reduced nerve conduction velocity with decreased amplitude and axonal
  loss without hypertrophic features. One form of CMT2 maps to chromosome 1 p36
  (CMT2A), another to chromosome 3p (CMT2B) and another to 7p (CMT2D).
  Dejerine-Sottas disease (DSD), also called hereditary motor and sensory
  neuropathy type III (HMSNIII), is a severe, infantile-onset demyelinating
  polyneuropathy that may be associated with point mutations in either the PMP22
  gene or the Po gene and shares considerable clinical and pathological features
  with CMT1. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is
  an autosomal dominant disorder that results in a recurrent, episodic
  demyelinating neuropathy. HNPP is associated with a 1.5-Mb deletion in
  chromosome 17p11.2-12 and results from reduced expression of the PMP22 gene.
  CMT1A and HNPP are reciprocal duplication/deletion syndromes originating from
  unequal crossover during germ cell meiosis.
