  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is a disorder
  of the peripheral nervous system, the cause of which has recently been
  identified as a deletion on chromosome 17p. The deletion corresponds to the
  duplication that is commonly observed in patients with hereditary motor and
  sensory neuropathy type Ia (HMSNIa, 17p11.2-p12). Therefore, the gene for
  peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP-22) is a candidate gene for both HMSNIa and
  HNPP. Here, we show that a similar deletion is present in one family with HNPP
  but is clearly absent in another family. Affected members of this family carry
  the expected two copies of the PMP-22 gene and the surrounding region.
  Furthermore, linkage analyses of this family exclude a large part of 17p,
  spanning the area deleted in other families with HNPP, as the location for the
  disease gene. These data strongly argue for the existence of genetic
  heterogeneity underlying HNPP. Results from two-point linkage analysis with
  markers on chromosome 1q are inconsistent with a possible involvement of the
  locus for HMSNIb in the present family.
