  The Charcot-Marie Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) duplication and hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) deletion are reciprocal
  products of an unequal crossing-over event between misaligned flanking
  CMT1A-REP repeats. The molecular aetiology of this apparently homologous
  recombination event was examined by sequencing the crossover region. Through
  the detection of novel junction fragments from the recombinant CMT1A-REPs in
  both CMT1A and HNPP patients, a 1.7-kb recombination hotspot within the
  approximately 30-kb CMT1A-REPs was identified. This hotspot is 98% identical
  between CMT1A-REPs indicating that sequence identity is not likely the sole
  factor involved in promoting crossover events. Sequence analysis revealed a
  mariner transposon-like element (MITE) near the hotspot which we hypothesize
  could mediate strand exchange events via cleavage by a transposase at or near
  the 3' end of the element.
