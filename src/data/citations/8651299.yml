abstract: >-
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) disease and hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are autosomal dominant neuropathies,
  associated, respectively, with duplications and deletions of the same 1.5-Mb
  region on 17p11.2-p12. These two rearrangements are the reciprocal products of
  an unequal meiotic crossover between the two chromosome 17 homologues, caused
  by the misalignment of the CMT1A repeat sequences (CMT1A-REPs), the homologous
  sequences flanking the 1.5-Mb CMT1A/HNPP monomer unit. In order to map
  recombination breakpoints within the CMT1A-REPs, a 12.9-kb restriction map was
  constructed from cloned EcoRI fragments of the proximal and distal CMT1A-REPs.
  Only 3 of the 17 tested restriction sites were present in the proximal
  CMT1A-REP but absent in the distal CMT1A-REP, indicating a high degree of
  homology between these sequences. The rearrangements were mapped in four
  regions of the CMT1A-REPs by analysis of 76 CMT1A index cases and 38 HNPP
  patients, who where unrelated. A hot spot of crossover breakpoints, located in
  a 3.2-kb region, accounted for three-quarters of the rearrangements, detected
  after EcoRI/SacI digestion, by the presence of 3.2-kb and 7.8-kb junction
  fragments in CMT1A and HNPP patients, respectively. These junction fragments,
  which can be detected on classical Southern blots, permit molecular diagnosis.
  Other rearrangements can also be detected by gene dosage on the same Southern
  blots.
