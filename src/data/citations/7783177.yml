  Assignment of microsatellite sequences to the region duplicated in CMT1A
  (17p12) a useful tool for diagnosis.
abstract: >-
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), the most prevalent form of the
  peripheral hereditary neuropathies, has been associated with a duplication of
  a genomic segment of 1.5 Mb, located in 17p11.2. Recently, the same segment
  has been found to be deleted in patients with another peripheral neuropathy,
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). Highly
  polymorphic markers are rare in this area, rendering the diagnosis highly
  dependent either on invasive examinations (like nerve biopsy) or not totally
  reliable (like gene dosage). Thus, we used a contig of YACs, including the
  whole region duplicated in CMT1A, to map highly polymorphic microsatellite
  loci, designed in Genethon. We showed that four of these loci are located in
  the duplicated region, allowing us to propose them as diagnostic markers for
  CMT1A and HNPP.
