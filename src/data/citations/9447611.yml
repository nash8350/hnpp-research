abstract: >-
  An epidemiological study of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP) was carried out in south western Finland, with a population of
  435,000. The diagnosis was established in 69 patients from 23 unrelated
  families through family and medical history, clinical neurological and
  neurophysiological examinations and with documentation of the deletion at gene
  locus 17p11.2 in at least one member of each family. This gave a prevalence of
  at least 16/100,000, which is remarkably high. However, due to the insidious
  nature of HNPP, most probably it is still an underestimation. This is the
  first population-based prevalence figure reported for HNPP. The prevalence is
  somewhat lower than that obtained for CMT in the same population, which agrees
  with the proposal that HNPP and CMT 1A are reciprocal products of the same
  unequal crossing-over. The clinical pictures of our patients were, in general,
  similar to those previously described in HNPP.
