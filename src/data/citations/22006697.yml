  Four novel point mutations in the PMP22 gene with phenotypes of HNPP and
  Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy.
abstract: >-
  We report four novel point mutations in the PMP22 gene with two different
  phenotypes mutation p.Ser79Thr arose de novo in a patient with the
  Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy (DSN) phenotype; and mutations c.78+5 G>A, c.320-1
  G>C, and p.Trp140Stop segregated with HNPP in 5 families.Our findings show
  that point mutations in PMP22 may be more likely in HNPP patients than in CMT1
  patients after exclusion of CMT1A/HNPP.
