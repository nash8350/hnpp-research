  Nerve ultrasound in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease has focused mostly on
  the upper limbs. We performed an evaluation of a large cohort of CMT patients
  in which we sonographically characterized nerve abnormalities in different
  disease types, ages, and nerves. Seventy patients affected by different CMT
  types and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) were
  evaluated, assessing median, ulnar, fibular, tibial, and sural nerves
  bilaterally. Data were correlated with age. Nerve dimensions were correlated
  with CMT type, age, and nerve site. Nerves were larger in demyelinating than
  in axonal neuropathies. Nerve involvement was symmetric. CMT1 patients had
  larger nerves than did patients with other CMT types. Patients with HNPP
  showed enlargement at entrapment sites. Our study confirms the general
  symmetry of ultrasound nerve patterns in CMT. When compared with ultrasound
  studies of nerves of the upper limbs, evaluation of the lower limbs did not
  provide additional information. Muscle Nerve 57 E18-E23, 2018.
