  We performed DNA analysis in four families with hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsy (HNPP). An interstitial deletion of the 17 p11.2
  region was found in typically affected patients as well as in as yet
  asymptomatic patients. The opportunity for an individual genotyping permitted
  to ascertain a de novo deletion in one clinically affected case with no
  relevant familial history. DNA analysis thus becomes the most sensitive tool
  in diagnosing HNPP, since potentially affected patients may lack either
  informative familial history, or clinical symptoms or even suggestive EMG or
  histopathological data (tomaculas).
