  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP) are the most frequent inherited disorders of the
  peripheral nervous system. They are clinically and genetically heterogeneous.
  A submicroscopic tandem duplication of 1. 5 Mb in chromosome 17p11.2-12
  comprising the PMP22 gene is found in 70.7% of autosomal dominant
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 (CMT1) patients. A reciprocal deletion is found in
  87.6% of HNPP patients. The size of the typical CMT1A duplication is too small
  for classical cytogenetics and the whole region including the CMT1A-REP
  elements is sometimes too complex for a single DNA analysis method. We present
  results of a multiplex PCR of 8 microsatellite markers with multicolour
  fluorescence primer labelling followed by fragment analysis on an ABI 310
  Prism analyzer to simplify the diagnostic procedure. Results for 24 patients
  can be obtained within 24 h. This method was applied on 92 DNA samples of
  unrelated patients carrying a typical CMT1A duplication previously confirmed
  by two colour fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH, probe c132G8) and
  EcoRI/SacI Southern blotting (probe pLR7.8). Three alleles of three different
  sizes were clearly detected at least once in 88 of them (95.6%). Subsequently
  this analysis was applied on 312 Czech patients and revealed a CMT1A/HNPP
  rearrangement in 109 out of them.
