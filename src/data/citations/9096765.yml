  Diagnosis of CMT1A duplications and HNPP deletions by interphase FISH
  implications for testing in the cytogenetics laboratory.
abstract: >-
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease type 1A is an inherited peripheral
  neuropathy characterized by slowly progressive distal muscle wasting and
  weakness, decreased nerve conduction velocities, and genetic linkage to 17p12.
  Most (> 98%) CMT1A cases are caused by a DNA duplication of a 1.5-Mb region in
  17p12 containing the PMP22 gene. The reciprocal product of the CMT1A
  duplication is a 1.5-Mb deletion which causes hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). The most informative current diagnostic
  testing requires pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to detect DNA
  rearrangement-specific junction fragments. We investigated the use of
  interphase FISH for the detection of duplications and deletions for these
  disorders in the clinical molecular cytogenetics laboratory. Established cell
  lines or blood specimens from 23 individuals with known molecular diagnoses
  and 10 controls were obtained and scored using a two-color FISH assay. At
  least 70% of CMT1A cells displayed three signals consistent with duplications.
  Using this minimum expected percentile to make a CMT1A duplication diagnosis,
  all patients with CMT1A showed a range of 71-92% of cells displaying at least
  three signals. Of the HNPP cases, 88% of cells displayed only one
  hybridization signal, consistent with deletions. The PMP22 locus from normal
  control individuals displayed a duplication pattern in approximately 9% of
  cells, interpreted as replication of this locus. The percentage of cells
  showing replication was significantly lower than in those cells displaying
  true duplications. We conclude that FISH can be reliably used to diagnose
  CMT1A and HNPP in the clinical cytogenetics laboratory and to readily
  distinguish the DNA rearrangements associated with these disorders from
  individuals without duplication or deletion of the PMP22 locus.
