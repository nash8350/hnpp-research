title: Peripheral neuropathy in patients with HIV infection consider dual pathology.
abstract: >-
  Two HIV infected patients presented with peripheral neuropathy, in one patient
  this was originally ascribed to HIV associated mononeuritis multiplex and in
  the other to stavudine. Investigations confirmed these diagnoses and in both
  cases genetic analysis identified a second hereditary aetiology in the first
  patient hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies and in the
  second hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy.
