  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Diagnosis in the
  first family (1947) confirmed.
abstract: >-
  In 1947, the Dutch neurologist De Jong published the first family with, what
  later would be called, hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP). We recently found a new case from this family and were able to
  confirm the diagnosis by DNA analysis.
