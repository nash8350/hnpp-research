  Rapid detection of verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli at a single-cell level
  under an epifluorescence microscope without culturing processes was
  accomplished by using the direct in situ PCR technique. We used a DNA primer
  set for amplification of the slt-I and slt-II genes encoding respectively
  verotoxin 1 and 2 (EVT and EVS primers). The bacterial cells were detected
  specifically by the HNPP (2-hydroxy-3-naphthoic acid-2'-phenylanilide
  phosphate)/Fast Red TR reaction technique. The direct in situ PCR with
  HNPP/Fast Red TR technique is applicable to the detection of
  verotoxin-producing bacteria with the slt-I or slt-II gene in not only
  Escherichia coli O157 but also VTEC of other serotypes.
