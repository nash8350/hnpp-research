  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy fulminant development
  with axonal loss during military training.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is characterised
  by recurrent mononeuropathies following minor trauma. We describe a case of
  fulminant HNPP beginning on the first day of military physical training.
  Protracted weakness, muscle atrophy, hand contractures, and multifocal sensory
  loss developed during a further three weeks of basic training. Nerve
  conduction changes were typical of HNPP, but without segmental slowing.
  Electromyographically, there was prominent acute denervation in muscles of the
  hands and right shoulder. Sural nerve biopsy demonstrated tomaculae and
  remyelination. Genetic testing revealed PMP-22 gene deletion. This case report
  demonstrates that HNPP can present with rapidly progressive peripheral nerve
  dysfunction and electrophysiological evidence of focal axonal loss.
