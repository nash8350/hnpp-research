  A report of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP)
  presenting with brachial plexopathy the value of complete electrodiagnostic
  testing.
abstract: >-
  Patients with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP)
  typically present with a mononeuropathy (particularly peroneal or ulnar palsy)
  or a brachial plexopathy. Careful electrodiagnostic testing has an important
  role in establishing the diagnosis of HNPP differentiating this condition from
  other inherited or acquired neuropathies as well as obviating the need for
  unnecessary surgeries. We present a case of a patient who presented with a
  painless brachial plexopathy who was found to have multiple sites of segmental
  demyelination on nerve conduction studies, consistent with HNPP. We review the
  clinical and electrodiagnostic features of HNPP including the key
  electrodiagnostic findings to screen for this disorder.
