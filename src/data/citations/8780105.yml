  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is commonly
  associated with a 1.5-megabase deletion on chromosome 17p11.2-12. We analyzed
  the phenotypic expression of the deletion in 39 HNPP patients from 16 families
  carrying the deletion. Two-thirds of the individuals had episodes of acute
  mononeuropathy, often involving nerve territories of the upper limbs or
  brachial plexus; however, 41% of affected subjects were unaware of their
  disease, and 25% were almost or totally free of symptoms; one-third complained
  of chronic symptoms and four older patients had a picture of polyneuropathy.
  Electrophysiologic abnormalities differed among affected subjects, ranging
  from conduction abnormalities localized at common entrapment sites to diffuse
  conduction slowing, usually more evident at entrapment sites; patients from
  one family had preeminent proximal involvement. The spectrum of phenotypic
  expression of deletion-associated HNPP appears to be broader than previously
  thought. The prevalence of the disease is probably underestimated, and the
  availability of molecular diagnosis should increase disease detection.
