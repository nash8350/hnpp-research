  A rapid and reliable detection system for the analysis of PMP22 gene dosage by
  MP/DHPLC assay.
abstract: >-
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are caused by a 1.5-Mb duplication and a
  deletion at chromosome 17p11.2-12 encompassing the peripheral myelin protein
  22 gene (PMP22), respectively. We developed a rapid and reliable detection
  system for duplications/deletions of the PMP22 gene based on measurement of
  gene copy number. The method involves amplification of a test locus with
  unknown copy number and a reference locus of known copy number by multiplex
  PCR (MP), followed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography
  (DHPLC) or capillary electrophoresis detection to identify single copy
  changes. Thirty-two patients with CMT1A, 17 patients with HNPP, and 61
  unaffected individuals were analyzed. Using the same competitive MP protocol,
  the measured PMP22 gene dosage revealed concordant results between DHPLC and
  capillary electrophoresis analysis. The results of the MP/DHPLC or the
  MP/capillary electrophoresis assay were all confirmed by PCR-restriction
  fragment length polymorphism analysis. We concluded that the MP/DHPLC assay is
  an efficient, accurate, and reliable technique for gene dosage determination
  of the PMP22 gene for CMT1A duplication and HNPP deletion. This technique
  further extends the application of DHPLC as an alternative method for the
  measurement of gene amplifications and heterozygous deletions in different
  genetic diseases.
