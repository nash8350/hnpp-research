  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) and hereditary
  motor-sensory neuropathy type IA (HMSN IA) are quite distinct clinical
  entities recently associated to deletion and duplication, respectively, of the
  17p11.2 segment including the gene for peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP-22).
  We studied the electrophysiological features of 48 HNPP and 62 HMSN IA motor
  nerves. Conduction velocities (CV) and compound muscle action potential
  amplitudes were significantly reduced and distal latencies prolonged in HMSN
  IA compared to HNPP. CV was uniformly slowed in HMSN IA nerves whereas in HNPP
  it was focally slowed in 80% of ulnar and 12% of peroneal nerves at usual
  compression sites. Conduction block was present in 6% of HNPP nerves but in
  none of HMSN IA. (1) HMSN IA with 17p11.2 duplication presents marked,
  diffuse, and uniform slowing; (2) HNPP with 17p11.2 deletion presents focal
  electrophysiological abnormalities possibly correlated with the presence of
  tomaculae; and (3) under- and overexpression of PMP-22 in concurrence with
  environmental factors might be responsible for the distinctive features of
  HNPP and HMSN IA.
