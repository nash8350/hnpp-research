  Alterations in peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) expression are associated
  with a heterogeneous group of hereditary demyelinating peripheral
  neuropathies. Two mutations at glycine 94, a single guanine insertion or
  deletion in PMP22, result in different reading frameshifts and, consequently,
  an extended G94fsX222 or a truncated G94fsX110 protein, respectively. Both of
  these autosomal dominant mutations alter the second half of PMP22 and yet are
  linked to clinical phenotypes with distinct severities. The G94fsX222 is
  associated with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies,
  whereas G94fsX110 causes severe neuropathy diagnosed as Dejerine-Sottas
  disease or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type IA. To investigate the subcellular
  changes associated with the G94 frameshift mutations, we expressed
  epitope-tagged forms in primary rat Schwann cells. Biochemical and
  immunolabeling studies indicate that, unlike the wild-type protein, which is
  targeted for the plasma membrane, frameshift PMP22s are retained in the cell,
  prior to reaching the medial Golgi compartment. Similar to Wt-PMP22, both
  frameshift mutants are targeted for proteasomal degradation and accumulate in
  detergent-insoluble, ubiquitin-containing aggregates upon inhibition of this
  pathway. The extended frameshift PMP22 shows the ability to form spontaneous
  aggregates in the absence of proteasome inhibition. On the other hand, Schwann
  cells expressing the truncated protein proliferate at a significantly higher
  rate than Schwann cells expressing the wild-type or the extended PMP22. In
  summary, these results suggest that a greater potential for PMP22 aggregation
  is associated with a less severe phenotype, whereas dysregulation of Schwann
  cell proliferation is linked to severe neuropathy.
