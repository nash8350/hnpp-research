  Comparative genomic hybridisation using a proximal 17p BAC/PAC array detects
  rearrangements responsible for four genomic disorders.
abstract: >-
  Proximal chromosome 17p is a region rich in low copy repeats (LCRs) and prone
  to chromosomal rearrangements. Four genomic disorders map within the interval
  17p11-p12 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A, hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies, Smith-Magenis syndrome, and dup(17)(p11.2p11.2)
  syndrome. While 80-90% or more of the rearrangements resulting in each
  disorder are recurrent, several non-recurrent deletions or duplications of
  varying sizes within proximal 17p also have been characterised using
  fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). A BAC/PAC array based comparative
  genomic hybridisation (array-CGH) method was tested for its ability to detect
  these genomic dosage differences and map breakpoints in 25 patients with
  recurrent and non-recurrent rearrangements. Array-CGH detected the dosage
  imbalances resulting from either deletion or duplication in all the samples
  examined. The array-CGH approach, in combination with a dependent statistical
  inference method, mapped 45/46 (97.8%) of the analysed breakpoints to within
  one overlapping BAC/PAC clone, compared with determinations done independently
  by FISH. Several clones within the array that contained large LCRs did not
  have an adverse effect on the interpretation of the array-CGH data. Array-CGH
  is an accurate and sensitive method for detecting genomic dosage differences
  and identifying rearrangement breakpoints, even in LCR-rich regions of the
  genome.
