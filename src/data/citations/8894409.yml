title: Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy with predilection for the brachial plexus is
  an autosomal dominant disorder associated with recurrent, episodic, painful
  brachial neuropathies. Mildly dysmorphic facial features including
  hypotelorism, long nasal bridge and upslanting palpebral fissures are present
  in affected people in some pedigrees with this disease. The molecular basis of
  hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy is unknown and the specific gene which leads
  to it has not been identified. The feature of brachial neuropathy is shared
  with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies, another
  autosomal dominant disorder which maps to chromosome 17p11.2-12 and may be
  clinically confused with hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy. Genetic studies have
  shown that the two diseases do not map to the same chromosomal region and are,
  therefore, genetically distinct disorders. Genetic linkage studies with
  polymerase chain reaction-based DNA markers in two large pedigrees recently
  localized the hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy gene to the distal long arm of
  chromosome 17 (17q24-qter).
