abstract: >-
  The peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) and the epithelial membrane proteins
  (EMP-1, -2, and -3) comprise a subfamily of small hydrophobic membrane
  proteins. The putative four-transmembrane domain structure as well as the
  genomic structure are highly conserved among family members. PMP22 and EMPs
  are expressed in many tissues, and functions in cell growth, differentiation,
  and apoptosis have been reported. EMP-1 is highly up-regulated during squamous
  differentiation and in certain tumors, and a role in tumorigenesis has been
  proposed. PMP22 is most highly expressed in peripheral nerves, where it is
  localized in the compact portion of myelin. It plays a crucial role in normal
  physiological and pathological processes in the peripheral nervous system.
  Progress in molecular genetics has revealed that genetic alterations in the
  PMP22 gene, including duplications, deletions, and point mutations, are
  responsible for several forms of hereditary peripheral neuropathies, including
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DDS),
  and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). The
  natural mouse mutants Trembler and Trembler-J contain a missense mutation in
  different hydrophobic domains of PMP22, resulting in demyelination and Schwann
  cell proliferation. Transgenic mice carrying many copies of the PMP22 gene and
  PMP22-null mice display a variety of defects in the initial steps of
  myelination and/or maintenance of myelination, whereas no pathological
  alterations are detected in other tissues normally expressing PMP22. Further
  characterization of the interactions of PMP22 and EMPs with other proteins as
  well as their regulation will provide additional insight into their normal
  physiological function and their roles in disease and possibly will result in
  the development of therapeutic tools.
