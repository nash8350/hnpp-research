  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) phenotypes are
  heterogeneous. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman without medical
  history, who complained of bilateral hand weakness suggestive first of a motor
  neuron disorder. The presence of a diffuse predominant distal demyelinating
  neuropathy suggested a deletion of PMP-22 gene, which was confirmed by genetic
  analysis. This case report underlines a novel phenotype related to the
  deletion of PMP-22 gene.
