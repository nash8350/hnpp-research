  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNLPP) is a
  peripheral nerve disorder in which recurrent pressure palsies are associated
  with pathological swelling ('tomacula') of myelinated nerve internodes. We
  report a patient with a slowly progressive polyneuropathy associated with
  substantial slowing of conduction velocities initially suggestive of an
  acquired or hereditary demyelinating polyneuropathy. However, repeat
  electrodiagnostic studies demonstrated that conduction slowing and partial
  conduction block were localized primarily to common sites of nerve compression
  and entrapment. Sural nerve biopsy revealed multiple tomacula consistent with
  the diagnosis of HNLPP.
