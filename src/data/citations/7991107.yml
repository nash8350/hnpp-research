title: >-
  Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy and hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies two distinct clinical, electrophysiologic, and genetic
  entities.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA) is an autosomal disease characterized by
  painful episodes of brachial palsy. The presence of tomacula in some patients
  suggested that HNA might be genetically related to hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), caused by point mutations in the PMP22
  gene or deletion of the region containing this gene. In a clinical,
  electrophysiologic, and molecular study of two families with HNA, we show that
  the PMP22 gene is not deleted, duplicated, or mutated in HNA and that the
  disease is not linked to any other gene in the HNPP deleted region. We
  conclude that HNA and HNPP are distinct genetic entities.
