  The authors describe a case of hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (entrapment), and compare it to reports from literature. The
  main characteristics are autosomal dominant inheritance, recurrent
  mononeuropathies (ulnar, median, peroneal, brachial plexus), and specific
  features at nerve biopsy. The sensory nerve reveals predominantly
  demyelinating alterations, having the remaining myelin fibres focal
  thickenings, the so called tomaculous, and shows numerous subperineural
  structures named Renaut Bodies. The EMG findings show a slowing of the nerve
  conduction velocities and an increase of distal latencies.
