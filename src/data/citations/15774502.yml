  Skin biopsies in myelin-related neuropathies bringing molecular pathology to
  the bedside.
abstract: >-
  Skin biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure and has been used in the
  evaluation of non-myelinated, but not myelinated nerve fibres, in sensory
  neuropathies. We therefore evaluated myelinated nerves in skin biopsies from
  normal controls and patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease caused by
  mutations in myelin proteins. Light microscopy, electron microscopy and
  immunohistochemistry routinely identified myelinated dermal nerves in glabrous
  skin that appeared similar to myelinated fibres in sural and sciatic nerve.
  Myelin abnormalities were observed in all patients with CMT. Moreover, skin
  biopsies detected potential pathogenic abnormalities in the axolemmal
  molecular architecture previously undetected in human neuropathies. Finally,
  myelin gene expression at both mRNA and protein levels was evaluated by
  real-time PCR and immunoelectron microscopy. Peripheral myelin protein 22
  (PMP22) was increased in CMT1A (PMP22 duplication) and decreased in patients
  with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (PMP22
  deletion). Taken together, our data suggest that skin biopsy may in certain
  circumstances replace the more invasive sural nerve biopsy in the
  morphological and molecular evaluation of inherited and other demyelinating
  neuropathies.
