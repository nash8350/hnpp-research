  Connexin32 gene mutations in X-linked dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
  (CMTX1).
abstract: >-
  Single-strand conformational polymorphisms (SSCP) of the connexin32 gene were
  analyzed in 121 patients possibly affected by Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT)
  disease. The 121 patients were selected from 443 possible CMT/HNPP (hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies) patients based on genetic
  linkage to Xq13.1, absence of the 17p12 duplication and deletion, and absence
  of point mutations in PMP22 and P0. We found five new mutations at nucleotides
  105 (C-T), 316 (C-G), 321 (C-T), 328 (T-C), and 657 (G-C), and three mutations
  at nucleotide 126 (C-T), 249 (G-A), and 477 (G-A) previously described in
  other unrelated families. The nucleotide changes resulted in seven amino-acid
  substitutions and one premature stop codon.
