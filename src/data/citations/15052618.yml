abstract: >-
  Polyneuropathy is invariably associated with the late-infantile form of
  metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), and occurs frequently in the early
  juvenile, juvenile, and adult variants. Uniform slowing of nerve conduction
  velocity is the neurophysiologic hallmark of metachromatic leukodystrophy and
  other inherited demyelinating polyneuropathies. To evaluate the consistency of
  this principle, we reviewed nerve conduction studies in 9 children with
  late-infantile or early-juvenile metachromatic leukodystrophy. Each child had
  significant slowing of motor nerve conduction velocity (NCV). The compound
  muscle action potentials showed abnormal temporal dispersion in 3 of the 9
  children, which is usually regarded as the hallmark of acquired demyelinating
  polyneuropathies. There are reports of multifocal slowing in other hereditary
  processes including X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies, and adrenomyeloneuropathy.
  Although multifocal NCV slowing in a child with polyneuropathy is seen most
  commonly in acquired conditions, a hereditary process, including MLD, cannot
  always be excluded in this setting.
