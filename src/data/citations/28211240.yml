  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) 1C due to mutations in LITAF/SIMPLE is a rare
  subtype amongst the autosomal dominant demyelinating forms of CMT. Our
  objective was to report the clinical and electrophysiological characteristics
  of 18 CMT1C patients and compare them to 20 patients with PMP22 mutations 10
  CMT1A patients and 10 patients with hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP). Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1C patients were followed-up in
  referral centres for neuromuscular diseases or were identified by familial
  survey. All CMT1A and HNPP patients were recruited at the referral centre for
  neuromuscular diseases of Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. Two phenotypes were
  identified amongst 18 CMT1C patients the classical CMT form ('CMT-like', 11
  cases) and a predominantly sensory form ('sensory form', seven cases). The
  mean CMT neuropathy score was 4.45 in CMT1C patients. Motor nerve conduction
  velocities in the upper limbs were significantly more reduced in CMT1A than in
  CMT1C patients. On the other hand, the motor nerve conduction velocity of the
  median nerve was significantly lower in CMT1C compared to the HNPP group.
  Distal motor latency was significantly more prolonged in CMT1A patients
  compared to the CMT1C and HNPP groups, the latter two groups having similar
  distal motor latency values. Molecular analysis revealed five new LITAF/SIMPLE
  mutations (Ala111Thr, Gly112Ala, Trp116Arg, Pro135Leu, Arg160Cys). Our study
  delineates CMT1C as mostly a mild form of neuropathy, and gives clinical and
  electrophysiological clues differentiating CMT1C from CMT1A and HNPP.
  Delineating phenotypes in CMT subtypes is important to orient molecular
  diagnosis and to help to interpret complex molecular findings.
