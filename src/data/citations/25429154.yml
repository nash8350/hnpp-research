  Haploinsufficiency of peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) causes hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies, a peripheral nerve lesion
  induced by minimal trauma or compression. As PMP22 is localized to
  cholesterol-enriched membrane domains that are closely linked with the
  underlying actin network, we asked whether the myelin instability associated
  with PMP22 deficiency could be mediated by involvement of the protein in
  actin-dependent cellular functions and/or lipid raft integrity. In peripheral
  nerves and cells from mice with PMP22 deletion, we assessed the organization
  of filamentous actin (F-actin), and actin-dependent cellular functions. Using
  in vitro models, we discovered that, in the absence of PMP22, the migration
  and adhesion capacity of Schwann cells and fibroblasts are similarly impaired.
  Furthermore, PMP22-deficient Schwann cells produce shortened myelin
  internodes, and display compressed axial cell length and collapsed
  lamellipodia. During early postnatal development, F-actin-enriched
  Schmidt-Lanterman incisures do not form properly in nerves from PMP22(-/-)
  mice, and the expression and localization of molecules associated with
  uncompacted myelin domains and lipid rafts, including flotillin-1,
  cholesterol, and GM1 ganglioside, are altered. In addition, we identified
  changes in the levels and distribution of cholesterol and ApoE when PMP22 is
  absent. Significantly, cholesterol supplementation of the culture medium
  corrects the elongation and migration deficits of PMP22(-/-) Schwann cells,
  suggesting that the observed functional impairments are directly linked with
  cholesterol deficiency of the plasma membrane. Our findings support a novel
  role for PMP22 in the linkage of the actin cytoskeleton with the plasma
  membrane, likely through regulating the cholesterol content of lipid rafts.
