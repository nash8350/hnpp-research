  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) is the most common hereditary sensory motor
  neuropathy. Advances in molecular diagnosis have increased the diagnostic
  possibilities of these patients. Retrospective study of 36 pediatric patients
  diagnosed with CMT in a tertiary center in 2003-2015. We found 16 patients
  were diagnosed by a duplication in PMP22; two cases were diagnosed of
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies, one with a point
  mutation in PMP22; a male with a mild demyelinating phenotype, without family
  history, was diagnosed with GJB1 mutation; in a patient with a peripheral
  hypotonia at birth and axonal pattern in EMG by mutation in MFN2; a gypsy
  patient, with consanguineous family, CMT4D, was identified by a mutation in
  the gene NDRG1; a patient with multiplex congenital arthrogryposis and vocal
  cord paralysis, whose mother had a scapular-peroneal syndrome, had a
  congenital spinal muscular atrophy with mild distal axonal neuropathy by
  mutation in gene TRPV4; three girls, from a gypsy consanguineous family, with
  axonal CMT with neuromyotonic discharges were diagnosed by a mutation in the
  gene HINT1; twelve patients haven't molecular diagnosis currently. CMT1A
  predominated in our series (44%), as previous studies. We emphasize the
  description of a patient with a mutation in TRPV4 recently described as a
  cause of CMT2C and three cases, of gypsy consanguineous family, with the same
  mutation in HINT1 gene, recently described as a cause of axonal neuropathy
  with neuromyotonia, autosomal recessive (AR-CMT2). The proportion of patients
  without molecular diagnosis is similar to main European series.
