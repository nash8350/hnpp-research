  We assessed seven patients with hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP) with 16 electrophysiological tests and cranial MRI for
  CNS abnormalities. Mean latencies differed between patients with HNPP and
  controls for the blink reflex, the jaw-opening reflex, and acoustic evoked
  potentials. MRI abnormalities were observed in four patients. Our study
  suggests subclinical but functionally relevant CNS myelin damage in HNPP.
