  A 69-year-old man was admitted with a chief complaint of progressive muscle
  weakness and tingling sensation in the distal portion of all extremities since
  the age of 55. On neurological examination, sensory impairment of all
  modalities was noted in the right side of face, segmental areas of the right
  Th4-10 and the distal portion of four extremities. Symmetrical muscle weakness
  and atrophy was also found over the distal portion of all extremities. All
  deep tendon reflexes except biceps brachii reflexes were absent.
  Neurophysiological studies, however, rather indicated mononeuritis multiplex
  in this case. The biopsied specimen of the sural nerve showed a significant
  decrease in large myelinated fibers and many tomaculous changes. The gene
  analysis revealed deletion in the CMT 1A locus on chromosome 17p11.2,
  providing evidence for the diagnosis of hereditary neuropathy with liability
  to pressure palsies (HNPP). The development of sensory impairment in face or
  thoracic nerves is quite rare in HNPP, indicating that there exists
  considerable phenotypic heterogeneity in the disease.
