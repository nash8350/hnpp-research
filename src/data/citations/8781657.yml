  The node of Ranvier in myelinated fibers is known to have an affinity to bind
  cations. Demyelination and remyelination due to abnormal expression of a
  myelin protein may affect cation binding or vice versa under pathological
  conditions. To study the cation binding at the node of Ranvier in inherited
  demyelinating neuropathies associated with over- and under-expression of the
  peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP-22), the reaction with ferric ion and
  ferrocyanide was used to visualize the cation binding sites in biopsied nerves
  of four patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and two
  patients with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP),
  and the results were compared with those of four patients having acquired
  neuropathies with normal PMP-22 expression. In CMT1A, nodal widening or
  paranodal demyelination was associated with dense precipitates focally on both
  sides of the widened node. Although fainter precipitates were present at the
  node between remyelinated internodes, the percentage of nodes exhibiting the
  reaction product between normal and remyelinated internodes was not
  statistically different from that between normal internodes in CMT1A. In
  acquired neuropathies, on the other hand, the difference was significant
  between the two (P < 0.05), with reduction between normal and remyelinated
  internodes. At the nodes neighboring demylinated internodes, the percentage of
  nodes exhibiting the reaction product was reduced significantly in both CMT1A
  and acquired neuropathies, but to a lesser degree in CMT1A. Precipitates were
  clearly seen at the nodes neighboring a tomaculum in HNPP. The results suggest
  that preserved cation binding at the node may allow nerves to keep the
  electrical excitability in CMT1A and HNPP where myelin remodeling takes place
  at high frequency.
