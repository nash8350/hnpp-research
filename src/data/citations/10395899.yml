  Identification and characterization of a new member of the gas3/PMP22 gene
  family in C. elegans.
abstract: >-
  The Gas3/PMP22 protein family is characterized by tetraspan transmembrane
  proteins. The gas3/PMP22 gene is highly expressed in Schwann cells of the
  peripheral nervous system, and different alterations of this gene are
  associated with hereditary demyelinating neuropathies, such as the
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A, the Dejerine-Sottas syndrome and the Hereditary
  Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP).Here, we report on the identification of
  at least one member of the Gas3/PMP22 family in the nematode C. elegans
  (C01C10.1b). C01C10.1b shares 36% of identical amino acids with the human
  Gas3/PMP22 and is characterized by four hydrophobic putative transmembrane
  domains. It lacks the typical N-linked glycosylation consensus in the first
  extracellular loop. C01C10.1b is transcribed as an operon downstream to the
  gene C01C10.1a, which encodes for a putative tetraspan protein with less
  conserved homology with the Gas3/PMP22 family. Interestingly, C01C10.1a
  contains three N-glycosylation sites at the C-terminus. Both genes are
  expressed in different nematode developmental stages and in the adults. The
  characterization of one member of the gas3/PMP22 family in C. elegans gives
  the opportunity to use this model organism to investigate the role of
  gas3/PMP22 in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation and its
  relation to the hereditary neurodegenerative diseases in humans.
