  The Thr(118)Met substitution in the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene
  has been detected in a number of families with demyelinating
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT1) neuropathy or with the hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsy, but in none of them has it consistently
  segregated with the peripheral neuropathy. We describe here a CMT1 family (a
  63-year-old man, his brother and his niece) in which two mutations on
  different chromosomes were found in the PMP22 gene, the 17p duplication,
  detected by fluorescent semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of
  microsatellite markers localized within the duplicated region on chromosome
  17p11.2-p12, and the Thr(118)Met substitution, detected by direct sequencing
  the four coding exons of the PMP22 gene. A genotype/phenotype correlation
  study showed that the neuropathy segregates with the duplication and that the
  amino acid substitution does not seem to modify the clinical characteristics
  or the severity of the peripheral neuropathy. We did not find any evidence to
  characterize this substitution as a polymorphism in the population studied and
  we propose that the high frequency reported for this point mutation in the
  literature suggests that the Thr(118)Met substitution may be a hotspot for
  mutations in the PMP22 gene.
