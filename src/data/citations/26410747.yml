  Recurrent focal neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is a relatively
  frequent autosomal-dominant demyelinating neuropathy linked to peripheral
  myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene deletions. The combination of PMP22 gene
  mutations with other genetic variants is known to cause a more severe
  phenotype than expected. We present the case of a patient with severe
  orthostatic hypotension since 12 years of age, who inherited a PMP22 gene
  deletion from his father. Genetic double trouble was suspected because of
  selective sympathetic autonomic disturbances. Through exome-sequencing
  analysis, we identified two novel mutations in the dopamine beta hydroxylase
  gene. Moreover, with interactome analysis, we excluded a further influence on
  the origin of the disease by variants in other genes. This case increases the
  number of unique patients presenting with dopamine-Î²-hydroxylase deficiency
  and of cases with genetically proven double trouble. Finding the right,
  complete diagnosis is crucial to obtain adequate medical care and appropriate
  genetic counseling.
