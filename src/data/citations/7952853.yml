title: Inherited neuropathies Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and related disorders.
abstract: >-
  Collectively, the inherited disorders of peripheral nerves represent a common
  group of neurological diseases and are frequently encountered in the clinical
  setting. Recent advances in molecular genetics have not only provided improved
  diagnosis and counselling, but may ultimately lead to specific, rational
  therapies for the various forms of inherited neuropathy. Charcot-Marie-Tooth
  neuropathy type 1 (CMT1) is a genetically heterogeneous group of chronic
  demyelinating polyneuropathies with loci mapping to chromosome 17p (CMT1A),
  chromosome 1q (CMT1B), the X chromosome (CMTX) and to another unknown autosome
  (CMT1C). CMT1A is most often associated with a tandem 1.5-megabase (Mb)
  duplication in chromosome 17p11.2-12, or may occasionally result from a point
  mutation in the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. CMT1B is associated
  with point mutations in the myelin protein zero (P0) gene. The molecular
  defect in CMT1C is unknown. CMTX is associated with defects in the connexin 32
  gene. Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 2 (CMT2) is an axonal neuropathy,
  also of undetermined cause. One locus for CMT2 has been assigned for
  chromosome 1p (CMT2A). Dejerine-Sottas disease is a severe, infantile-onset,
  demyelinating polyneuropathy which may be associated with point mutations in
  the P0 or PMP22 genes. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder that results in a recurrent,
  episodic demyelinating neuropathy. HNPP is associated with a 1.5-Mb deletion
  in chromosome 17p11.2-12 and may result from reduced expression of the PMP22
  gene. CMT1A and HNPP are apparent reciprocal duplication/deletion syndromes
  originating from unequal cross-over during germ-cell meiosis.
