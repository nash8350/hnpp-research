  The major Charcot- Marie-Tooth Type 1 (CMT1) locus, CMT1A, and Hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) cosegregate with a 1.5-Mb
  duplication and a 1.5-Mb deletion, respectively, in band 17p11.2. Point
  mutations in peripheral myelin gene 22 (PMP22), myelin protein zero (MPZ), and
  connexin 32 (Cx32) have been reported in CMT1, and in PMP22 in HNPP patients
  without deletion. We have screened 54 CMT1 patients, of variable clinical
  severity, and 25 HNPP patients from Turkey, with no duplication or deletion,
  for mutations in the PMP22 and Cx32 genes. A novel frameshift mutation
  affecting the second extracellular domain of PMP22 was found in an HNPP
  patient, while a point mutation in the second transmembrane domain of the
  protein was detected in a CMT1 patient. Two point mutations affecting
  different domains of Cx32 were identified in two CMTX patients. Another
  patient was found to carry a polymorphism in a non-conserved codon of the Cx32
  gene. The clinical phenotypes of the patients correlate well with the effect
  of the mutation on the protein.
