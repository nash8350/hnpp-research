  During the last decade, molecular biology has demonstrated the extraordinary
  heterogeneity of genetic abnormalities in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT).
  The main phenotypes are either of the demyelinating or axonal type,
  transmitted with dominant or recessive autosomal inheritance. X-linked CMT is
  less rare than it was initially described and is often misdiagnosed as
  autosomal dominant type. Linked phenotypes are Dejerine-Sottas disease,
  congenital hypomyelinization and hereditary neuropathy with susceptibility to
  pressure palsies. Each phenotype can be due to different genotypes and
  concerned genes are numerous. Conversely, each genotype can express different
  phenotypes. Molecular diagnostic strategy of CMT is mainly baised on three
  elements - phenotypic expertise which is based on the analysis of the
  inheritance mode and on electrophysiological data, which are peculiar in CMTX
  - knowledge of respective occurrence of the different genotypes and phenotypes
  which is increasing - technical feasibility of molecular biology methods which
  is important to consider, even though progress are fastly coming. According to
  these considerations, a strategy is proposed for molecular diagnosis of CMT.
