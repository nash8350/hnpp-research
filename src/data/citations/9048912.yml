abstract: >-
  The crossover breakpoints for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are located in
  the CMT1A-REP repeat flanking a 1.5-Mb region of chromosome 17p11.2-12. The
  precise locations of the breakpoints are heterogeneous, and we analyzed the
  relative frequency distribution of breakpoints in 33 unrelated Japanese CMT1A
  and 3 unrelated HNPP families. The CMT1A-REP repeat region was divided into
  five regions, A, B, C, D and E, based on restriction site differences between
  the proximal and distal CMT1A-REP repeats. The frequency distribution of
  breakpoints within the CMT1A-REP repeat in the Japanese patients was 3% in
  region A, .78% in B/C and 19% in D, which is similar to that in Caucasian
  patients. This result also indicates that an 8-kb region defined by region B/C
  is a recombinational hotspot within the CMT1A-REP repeat in Japanese patients.
