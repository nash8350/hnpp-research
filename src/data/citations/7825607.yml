  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent mononeuropathies. A
  1.5-Mb deletion in chromosome 17p11.2-p12 has been associated with HNPP.
  Duplication of the same 1.5-Mb region is known to be associated with
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1A), a more severe peripheral
  neuropathy characterized by symmetrically slowed nerve conduction velocity
  (NCV). The CMT1A duplication and HNPP deletion appear to be the reciprocal
  products of a recombination event involving a repeat element (CMT1A-REP) that
  flanks the 1.5-Mb region involved in the duplication/deletion. Patients from
  nine unrelated Italian families who were diagnosed with HNPP on the basis of
  clinical, electrophysiological, and histological evaluations were analyzed by
  molecular methods for DNA deletion on chromosome 17p. In all nine families,
  Southern analysis using a CMT1A-REP probe detected a reduced hybridization
  signal of a 6.0-kb EcoRI fragment mapping within the distal CMT1A-REP,
  indicating deletion of one copy of CMT1A-REP in these HNPP patients. Families
  were also typed with a polymorphic (CA)n repeat and with RFLPs corresponding
  to loci D17S122, D17S125, and D17S61, which all map within the deleted region.
  Lack of allelic transmission from affected parent to affected offspring was
  observed in four informative families, providing an independent indication for
  deletion. Furthermore, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of
  SacII-digested genomic DNA detected junction fragments specific to the 1.5-Mb
  HNPP deletion in seven of nine Italian families included in this study. These
  findings suggest that a 1.5-Mb deletion on 17p11.2-p12 is the most common
  mutation associated with HNPP.
