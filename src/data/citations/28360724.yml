  The Activation of RAGE and NF-KB in Nerve Biopsies of Patients with Axonal and
  Vasculitic Neuropathy.
abstract: >-
  The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a pattern
  recognition receptor expressed in tissues and cells, which plays a role in
  immunity. The activation of RAGE results in the translocation of nuclear
  factor kappa B (NF-κB) to the nucleus for expression of proinflammatory
  molecules. The role of the RAGE pathway in the pathogenesis of diabetic
  complications is well determined. We aimed to investigate the role of the RAGE
  pathway in axonal and vasculitic neuropathy. We immunoreacted nerve biopsy
  samples from 17 axonal neuropathy (AN), 11 vasculitic neuropathy (VN) and 12
  hereditary neuropathy (as a control group) with liability to pressure palsy
  (HNPP) patients with antibodies to NF-κB and RAGE. Subsequently, we performed
  double staining with the antibodies to NF-κB or RAGE and T cells, macrophages
  and Schwann cells. RAGE and NF-κB immunoreactivities were higher in the
  perivascular cuff and in endoneurial cells in VN than in AN and HNPP. Although
  there is no significant difference, nerve biopsies with AN showed higher NFκB
  and RAGE immunoreactivities than HNPP. The colocalization study showed that
  most of the NFκB- and RAGE-positive cells were CD8 (+) T cells in VN. In AN,
  all NFκB- and RAGE-positive cells were macrophages, whereas all NFκB- and
  RAGE-positive cells were Schwann cells in HNPP. The activation of the RAGE
  pathway predominant in CD8 (+) T cells underscores its role in VN. In AN
  patients, the immunoreactivity to NFκB and RAGE in macrophages may support
  their role in axonal degeneration without inflammatory milieu.
