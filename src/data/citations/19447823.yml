  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) is caused by a 1.4 Mb duplication
  on chromosome 17p11.2, which contains the peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22)
  gene. Increased levels of PMP22 in compact myelin of peripheral nerves have
  been demonstrated and presumed to cause the phenotype of CMT1A. The objective
  of the present study was to determine whether an extra copy of the PMP22 gene
  in CMT1A disrupts the normally coordinated expression of PMP22 protein in
  peripheral nerve myelin and to evaluate PMP22 over-expression in patients with
  CMT1A and determine whether levels of PMP22 are molecular markers of disease
  severity. PMP22 expression was measured by taking skin biopsies from patients
  with CMT1A (n = 20) and both healthy controls (n = 7) and patients with
  Hereditary Neuropathy with liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP) (n = 6), in
  which patients have only a single copy of PMP22. Immunological electron
  microscopy was performed on the skin biopsies to quantify PMP22 expression in
  compact myelin. Similar biopsies were analysed by real time PCR to measure
  PMP22 mRNA levels. Results were also correlated with impairment in CMT1A, as
  measured by the validated CMT Neuropathy Score. Most, but not all patients
  with CMT1A, had elevated PMP22 levels in myelin compared with the controls.
  The levels of PMP22 in CMT1A were highly variable, but not in HNPP or the
  controls. However, there was no correlation between neurological disabilities
  and the level of over-expression of PMP22 protein or mRNA in patients with
  CMT1A. The extra copy of PMP22 in CMT1A results in disruption of the tightly
  regulated expression of PMP22. Thus, variability of PMP22 levels, rather than
  absolute level of PMP22, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of
  CMT1A.
