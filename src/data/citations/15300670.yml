abstract: >-
  Two genes were identified for autosomal recessive forms of early onset
  Parkinson's disease parkin and DJ-1. We describe 2 siblings with EOPD due to
  parkin mutations and peripheral neuropathy, which presented as neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) in the index case. RT-PCR experiments
  revealed that the parkin gene is expressed in sural nerves from both controls
  and patient with parkin-related disease. Our findings support the view that
  parkin may play a role in the peripheral nervous system.
