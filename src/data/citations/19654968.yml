  We identified Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) in a family with
  schwannomas in the spinal cord and median nerve. The CMT1A in this family
  showed an autosomal dominant pattern, like other CMT patients with PMP22
  duplication, and the family also indicated a possible genetic predisposition
  to schwannomas by 'mother-to-son' transmission. CMT1A is mainly caused by
  duplication of chromosome 17p11.2-p12 (PMP22 gene duplication). A schwannoma
  is a benign encapsulated tumor originating from a Schwann cell. A case of
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) concurrent
  with schwannoma has been previously reported. Although it seems that the
  co-occurrence of CMT1A and schwannomas in a family would be the result of
  independent events, we could not completely ignore the possibility that the
  coincidence of two diseases might be due to a shared genetic background.
