  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy an investigation in a
  rare and large Chinese family.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP), mainly
  associated with the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene, is generally an
  autosomal-dominant inherited peripheral neuropathy. The present large family
  including four generations provides an exciting opportunity to gain important
  insights into HNPP in China. A large 43-member family with ten members
  suspected to be affected by HNPP was studied. Neurologic examinations,
  electrophysiological and neuropathological studies and molecular genetic
  testing were used for these kindred. Clinically, the proband had limb
  hyposthenia and atrophy, and his mother showed declined tendon reflexes in the
  right lower limb. Electrophysiologically, sensory and motor nerve conduction
  velocities were generalized reduced. Sural nerve biopsy for the proband showed
  focal thickesning of the myelin sheaths. Furthermore, real-time quantitative
  PCR demonstrated that the PMP22 gene has a higher Ct value than reference gene
  in all suspected patients. These results indicated that the family is indeed a
  rare and large pedigree of HNPP caused by the deletion of PMP22 gene. Given
  that the suspected patient in the fourth generation is absent, this family is
  still worthy of further follow-up study.
