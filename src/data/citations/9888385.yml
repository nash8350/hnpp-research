  The peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (PMP22), the myelin protein zero gene
  (MPZ, P0), and the connexin 32 gene (Cx32, GJB1) code for membrane proteins
  expressed in Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The early
  growth response 2 gene (EGR2) encodes a transcription factor that may control
  myelination in the PNS. Mutations in the respective genes, located on human
  chromosomes 17p11.2, 1q22-q23, Xq13.1, and 10q21.1-q22.1, are associated with
  several inherited peripheral neuropathies. To date, a genetic defect in one of
  these genes has been identified in over 1,000 unrelated patients manifesting a
  wide range of phenotypes, i.e., Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1) and
  type 2 (CMT2), Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS), hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), and congenital hypomyelination (CH).
  This large number of genetically defined patients provides an exceptional
  opportunity to examine the correlation between phenotype and genotype.
