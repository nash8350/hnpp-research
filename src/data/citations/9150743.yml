  Polymorphisms in the PMP-22 gene region (17p11.2-12) are crucial for
  simplified diagnosis of duplications/deletions.
abstract: >-
  DNA duplications and deletions of a 1.5-Mb region in chromosome 17p11.2-12
  comprising the gene encoding peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP-22) are the
  common mutations in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1) and hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). A 1.7-kb recombination
  hotspot region has been identified within misaligned flanking repeats
  (CMT1-REP elements) by detection of CMT- and HNPP-specific junction fragments
  in Southern blot analyses. In order to simplify routine diagnosis we introduce
  a polymerase chain reaction-based method to identify directly specific REP
  junction fragments. Using this test, specific fragments were detected in
  approximately 67% of both CMT duplication and HNPP deletion cases.
  Polymorphism within a specific restriction enzyme recognition site is crucial
  for both Southern blot and PCR analyses of junction fragments.
