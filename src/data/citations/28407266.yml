  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy in patients under 30
  years old Neurophysiological data and proposed electrodiagnostic criteria.
abstract: >-
  In young patients with mononeuropathy who lack family history and
  precipitating factors, hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy
  (HNPP) may be a possibility. Our objective is to propose neurophysiological
  criteria for HNPP in patients <30 years of age. We conducted a national
  multicenter retrospective clinical and neurophysiological study in patients
  under 30 with genetically confirmed HNPP. All of the 51 patients included in
  the study had at least 1 demyelinating pattern in 2 asymptomatic nerves, and 3
  abnormalities were found in almost 90%, including slowed motor nerve
  conduction velocity across the elbow in at least 1 ulnar nerve (97.5%),
  increased distal motor latency (DML) in at least 1 fibular nerve (95.8%), and
  increased DML in both median nerves (89%). Age influenced DML slightly only in
  the fibular nerve. Dissemination of nerve involvement in HNPP incites to
  perform a complete nerve conduction study. including bilateral ulnar, fibular,
  and median nerves. Muscle Nerve 57 217-221, 2018.
