title: >-
  A transgenic mouse model for human hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies.
abstract: >-
  Mutations in the gene encoding peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) account
  for several inherited peripheral neuropathies in humans. We now show that
  transgenic mice expressing antisense PMP22 RNA exhibit modestly reduced levels
  of PMP22 together with a phenotype that is reminiscent of hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), a human disease caused
  by a 1.5-Mb deletion of a chromosome 17 region that contains the PMP22 gene.
  Transgenic antisense homozygotes display a striking movement disorder and a
  slowing of nerve conduction that worsens with age. Morphological analysis of
  peripheral nerves demonstrates that a subset of axons have thickened myelin
  sheaths and tomacula in young adults, with significant myelin degeneration
  detected in older animals. Together with other recent work, these data suggest
  that dosage of the PMP22 gene alone underlies the pathophysiology observed in
  HNPP and related disorders.
