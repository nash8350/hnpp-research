  Comparison of two PCR-based molecular methods in the diagnosis of CMT 1A and
  HNPP diseases in Chinese.
abstract: >-
  Current molecular diagnostic methods in detecting Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A
  (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP)
  diseases are either not sensitive or time-consuming and costing. The aims of
  this study are improving the accuracy and speeding up the diagnosis. We
  developed real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) and three polymorphic short tandem
  repeats (STRs) methods to test 53 unrelated CMT1A patients, 12 unrelated HNPP
  patients and 100 normal control subjects. QPCR in detection of pmp22 gene
  duplication (CMT1A) and deletion (HNPP) showed a sensitivity of 100.00%
  (53/53) and 100.00% (12/12), respectively. And this method also showed a
  specificity of 100% (100/100) in CMT1A and 100% (100/100) in HNPP,
  respectively. In contrast, using three polymorphic STRs method showed a
  sensitivity of 50/53 (94%) in CMT1A and 12/12 (100.00%) of HNPP patients,
  respectively. And this method showed a specificity of 97% (100/103) in CMT1A
  and 100% (100/100) in HNPP, respectively. QPCR and three STRs methods both
  demonstrate a rapid and robust diagnosis with almost complete informativeness.
  The high sensitivity and heterozygosity of these three polymorphic markers in
  detecting CMT1A/HNPP subjects of Caucasian and Chinese showed the potential to
  become pan-ethnic screening markers in the future.
