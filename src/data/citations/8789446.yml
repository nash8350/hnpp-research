  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant neuropathy, most often associated with a deletion of the
  17p11.2 region, which is duplicated in 70% of patients with
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 (CMT1A). Most de novo CMT1A and HNPP cases have
  been of paternal origin. A rare case of de novo HNPP of maternal origin was
  analysed to determine the underlying mechanism. Affected individuals in the
  family carried a deletion corresponding to the CMT1A/HNPP monomer unit
  associated with a rearrangement of the CMT1A-REP sequences. Segregation
  analysis of 17p11-p12 markers in the family indicated that the deletion was
  not generated by unequal crossing over between homologous 17 chromosomes, as
  in de novo cases from paternal origin, but rather by an intrachromosomal
  rearrangement. Two distinct mechanisms can therefore lead to the same 17p11.2
  deletion. This result suggests that intrachromosomal rearrangement may be
  specific to maternal transmissions.
