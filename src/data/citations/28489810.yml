  A case report of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  accompanied by type 2 diabetes mellitus and psoriasis.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is an episodic,
  multifocal neuropathy, with a typical clinical presentation of recurrent
  transient pressure palsies, which is induced by a PMP22 deletion. Another
  neuropathy caused by a PMP22 duplication is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type
  1A (CMT1A). PMP22 is a gene coding a protein called peripheral myelin protein
  22 (PMP22), which plays an essential role in the formation and maintenance of
  compact myelin. Coexistence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and CMT1A has
  been reported in many work, however HNPP patients with T2DM are rare, and
  comorbidity of HNPP and psoriasis has not been reported previously.
  Electrophysiological features of HNPP has been found progressing with aging.
  Patient concerns Here we present a 20-year-old man who exhibited lower
  extremity weakness and foot drop as the initial manifestation. HNPP was
  diagnosed on the basis of clinical features, positive sural nerve biopsy
  findings, and genetic testing results. Moreover, physical examination,
  blood/urine glucose test, and diabetes-related autoantibodies investigations
  demonstrated that he had psoriasis and T2DM. The electrophysiological
  manifestations revealed profound demyelinating injuries and axonal injuries in
  distal peripheral nerves and facial nerves, which were more severe than
  general HNPP cases. The young patient was treated with continuous subcutaneous
  insulin infusion and blood glucose monitoring, and then transferred to oral
  acarbose therapy. The psoriatic lesions were treated with calcipotriol
  ointment. In the follow-up, the right leg weakness was alleviated, and his
  gait was improved. The findings indicate that diabetes mellitus may have an
  impact on the severity of HNPP. Physicians should consider that worsening of
  symptoms might result from newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus while treating
  patients with HNPP.
