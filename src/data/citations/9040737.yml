  Peripheral myelin protein PMP22 deficiency is associated with hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). Most HNPP cases are
  caused by a 1.5-megabase deletion in chromosome 17p11.2-12, a region that
  contains the PMP22 gene, whereas point mutations leading to HNPP are extremely
  rare. We have identified a family with clinical and electrophysiologic
  features of HNPP,in which all affected members are heterozygous carriers of a
  single base insertion in codon 94. This mutation is predicted to alter the
  reading frame and to result in a delayed termination signal. We conclude that
  the functional consequences of the frameshift are equivalent to those of the
  PMP22 deletion allele.
