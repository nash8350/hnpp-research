  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to recurrent pressure-sensitive palsies
  (HNPP; also called tomaculous neuropathy) is an autosomal dominant disorder
  that produces an episodic, recurrent demyelinating neuropathy. HNPP generally
  develops during adolescence, and may cause attacks of numbness, muscular
  weakness, and atrophy. Peroneal palsies, carpal-tunnel syndrome, and other
  entrapment neuropathies are frequent manifestations of this disorder. Motor
  and sensory nerve conduction velocities may be reduced in clinically affected
  patients, as well as in asymptomatic gene carriers. Pathological changes
  observed in peripheral nerves of HNPP patients include segmental demyelination
  and tomaculous or "sausage-like" formations. Because of mild overlap of
  clinical features with CMT1, HNPP patients may be misdiagnosed as having CMT1.
  HNPP and CMT1 are both demyelinating neuropathies; however, their clinical,
  pathological, and electrophysiological features are quite distinct. The HNPP
  locus maps to chromosome 17p11.2-12 and is associated with a 1.5-Mb deletion.
  DNA markers known to map to the region in 17p11.2-12 associated with the CMT1A
  duplication, including the PMP22 gene, are deleted in HNPP. The deletion
  breakpoints in HNPP map to the same intervals in which the CMT1A duplication
  breakpoints map. In one pedigree, de novo deletion of paternal origin was
  detected as a basis for sporadic HNPP. HNPP results from deletion of the PMP22
  gene and underexpression of this locus, which is reflected in reduced mRNA and
  protein levels in sural nerve biopsy samples from HNPP patients. Further
  support for this hypothesis was provided by the identification of a nondeleted
  HNPP kindred in which a two base pair deletion and early termination codon
  within exon 1 of PMP22 was present. The possibility of genetic heterogeneity
  in HNPP was raised by the identification of an HNPP pedigree that did not
  demonstrate linkage to the region of 17p11.2-12. Hereditary neuralgic
  amyotrophy (familial brachial plexus neuropathy) is an autosomal dominant
  disorder causing painful, recurrent brachial plexopathies and maps to
  chromosome 17q25.
