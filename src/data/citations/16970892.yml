  We report on the aggravation of absence seizures by lamotrigine leading to
  absence status epilepticus in a child. The patient is a 10-year-old girl with
  a history of absence seizures, learning disabilities, and hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Lamotrigine (up to 12
  mg/kg/day) was prescribed after a brief course of valproate was associated
  with restlessness. Long-acting methylphenidate was also administered. The
  initial response to lamotrigine appeared to be excellent. The first episode of
  absence status epilepticus occurred during a febrile illness while lamotrigine
  was being gradually discontinued. Following this event, lamotrigine dose was
  increased to 10 mg/kg/day and methylphenidate was continued. Six weeks later,
  a second absence status epilepticus episode ensued without fever. Sulthiame
  and clonazepam were substituted for lamotrigine, whereas methylphenidate
  therapy was continued. A psychiatrist prescribed risperidone 1 month later
  owing to obsessive-compulsive behavior. Nine months later, she remained free
  of absence seizures. Whereas the first absence status epilepticus event could
  have been triggered by fever, the second episode occurred while the daily
  lamotrigine dose was being increased. Moreover, the patient is seizure free
  following lamotrigine discontinuation. Hence, it is quite possible that
  lamotrigine caused seizure aggravation and absence status epilepticus in this
  child.
