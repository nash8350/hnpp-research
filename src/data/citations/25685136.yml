  It is generally regarded that patients with hereditary neuropathy to pressure
  palsies, due to a deletion in the PMP22 gene, show recurrent pressure palsy
  and generalised peripheral neuropathy (pes cavus and hammer toes sometimes
  develop). Brachial plexopathy is rarely identified as a first presentation of
  hereditary neuropathy to pressure palsies. We describe a young man who
  developed a painless flail upper limb with a clinical diagnosis of a brachial
  plexopathy after his partner slept on his arm - a PMP22 deletion was found.
  His father, who had a symmetrical polyneuropathy without recurrent
  mononeuropathies, shared the PMP22 deletion.
