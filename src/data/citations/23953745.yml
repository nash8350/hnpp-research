  The authors report two clinical cases of a rarely observed pathology in
  orthopedic surgery daily practice hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsy (HNPP), which leads to dysesthesiae, hypoesthesiae and
  regressive palsies. Onset, clinical signs and electromyographic abnormalities
  are described. Forensic consequences can occur in early postoperative period.
  Knowledge of this familial pathology allows precautionary measures at surgery
  and avoids unnecessary surgical revisions.
