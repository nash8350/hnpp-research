  Hereditary peripheral neuropathies (hereditary motor-sensory neuropathies or
  hereditary demyelinating neuropathies) are abnormalities of Schwann cells and
  their myelin sheaths, with peripheral nerve dysfunction. They include
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Dejerine-Sottas disease, congenital
  hypomyelinating neuropathy and hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsy. The objective of the present work was to describe a case of
  Dejerine-Sottas disease. A 9-year-old boy presented progressive slight motor
  deficit in the lower limbs, particularly in the feet, and generalized
  hyporeflexia. Electromyography disclosed significant reduction in motor and
  sensory nerve conduction velocities. Sural nerve biopsy showed axons
  surrounded by a thin myelin sheath and concentrically arranged cytoplasmic
  processes of Schwann cells forming onion-bulbs. No axon damage was observed.
