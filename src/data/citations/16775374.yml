  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP; also called
  tomaculous neuropathy) is an autosomal-dominant disorder that produces a
  painless episodic, recurrent, focal demyelinating neuropathy. HNPP generally
  develops during adolescence, and may cause attacks of numbness, muscular
  weakness, and atrophy. Peroneal palsies, carpal tunnel syndrome, and other
  entrapment neuropathies may be frequent manifestations of HNPP. Motor and
  sensory nerve conduction velocities may be reduced in clinically affected
  patients, as well as in asymptomatic gene carriers. The histopathological
  changes observed in peripheral nerves of HNPP patients include segmental
  demyelination and tomaculous or "sausage-like" formations. Mild overlap of
  clinical features with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease type 1 (CMT1) may
  lead patients with HNPP to be misdiagnosed as having CMT1. HNPP and CMT1 are
  both demyelinating neuropathies, however, their clinical, pathological, and
  electrophysiological features are quite distinct. HNPP is most frequently
  associated with a 1.4-Mb pair deletion on chromosome 17p12. A duplication of
  the identical region leads to CMT1A. Both HNPP and CMT1A result from a dosage
  effect of the PMP22 gene, which is contained within the deleted/duplicated
  region. This is reflected in reduced mRNA and protein levels in sural nerve
  biopsy samples from HNPP patients. Treatment for HNPP consists of preventative
  and symptom-easing measures. Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA; also called
  familial brachial plexus neuropathy) is an autosomal-dominant disorder causing
  episodes of paralysis and muscle weakness initiated by severe pain.
  Individuals with HNA may suffer repeated episodes of intense pain, paralysis,
  and sensory disturbances in an affected limb. The onset of HNA is at birth or
  later in childhood with prognosis for recovery usually favorable; however,
  persons with HNA may have permanent residual neurological dysfunction
  following attack(s). Episodes are often triggered by infections,
  immunizations, the puerperium, and stress. Electrophysiological studies show
  normal or mildly prolonged motor nerve conduction velocities distal to the
  affected brachial plexus. Pathological studies have found axonal degeneration
  in nerves examined distal to the plexus abnormality. In some HNA pedigrees
  there are characteristic facial features, including hypotelorism. The
  prognosis for recovery of normal function of affected limbs in HNA is good,
  although recurrent episodes may cause residual deficits. HNA is genetically
  linked to chromosome 17q25, where mutations in the septin-9 (SEPT9) gene have
  been found.
