  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies presenting with
  sciatic neuropathy.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal-dominant disorder associated with recurrent mononeuropathies
  following compression or trivial trauma. Reports on sciatic neuropathy as the
  presenting manifestation of HNPP are very scarce. We report on a 21-year-old
  previously healthy man who was admitted with sensorimotor deficits in his left
  leg. He had no history of preceding transient episodes of weakness or sensory
  loss. Clinical and electrophysiological examinations were consistent with
  sciatic neuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid investigation and MRI of the nerve
  roots, plexus, and sciatic nerve did not indicate the underlying aetiology.
  When extended electrophysiological tests revealed multiple subclinical
  compression neuropathies in the upper limbs, HNPP was contemplated and
  eventually confirmed by genetic testing.
