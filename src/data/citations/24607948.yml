  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is a clinically and genetically
  heterogeneous group of diseases with over 45 different causative gene
  mutations identified. Nerve conduction studies are important for the
  classification and diagnosis of CMT, whereas ultrasound (US) is increasingly
  used to assess the peripheral nerves of patients with CMT, as a complement to
  neurophysiological studies. Recent ultrasound assessment reports of peripheral
  nerves in CMT are summarized here. An ultrasound finding of CMT1A, which is
  the most common demyelinating subtype of CMT, is characterized by uniform
  enlargement of peripheral nerves and nerve roots. Patients with CMT1B (MPZ
  mutation) also have larger nerves than normal subjects do. Peripheral nerves
  of patients with CMT2, which is an axonal type of CMT, are slightly larger
  than those of normal subjects. Focal enlargement of nerves at entrapment sites
  is a characteristic US finding of hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsy. US findings of CMT are thus subtype-specific. Therefore, the
  assessment of nerve US may become a useful supporting tool for the diagnosis
  of CMT subtypes.
