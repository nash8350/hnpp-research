abstract: >-
  The phenomenon of gene dosage effects demonstrates that the mechanisms of some
  genetic diseases are best recognised at the genomic level. Classical gene
  mutation screening approaches utilising PCR are unsuccessful in unravelling
  the basis of disease because the gene sequence is unaltered and only the copy
  number is different. Techniques for detecting DNA dosage are required.
  Examples of haploinsufficiency and gene deletions are well documented, but
  increased gene dosage is also an important genetic mechanism in disorders
  involving myelin proteins in the central (CNS) and peripheral nervous system
  (PNS). Here we review the dosage effects and mutations of the proteolipid
  protein (PLP) gene that causes Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) and spastic
  paraplegia Type 2 (SPG2) disorders of CNS myelination. Similarities are drawn
  with the peripheral neuropathies Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Type 1 (CMT1A)
  and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) that are
  also caused by dosage effects and mutations in a single myelin protein gene
  (peripheral myelin protein 22, PMP-22). We compare the different mutational
  mechanisms in man and analogous mouse models that suggest a function for PLP
  beyond its structural role in myelin. We focus on the increased dosage of the
  PLP gene that is the major cause of PMD and results from a submicroscopic
  duplication of Xq22. Other clinical phenotypes may arise from gene dosage
  imbalance with the potential effect of submicroscopic duplications and
  deletions of the genome being underestimated. Genome sequencing may identify
  intrinsic structural properties of the DNA with greater susceptibility to
  these rearrangements and thereby reflect structural changes in the genome.
