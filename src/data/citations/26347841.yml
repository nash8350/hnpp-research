  This is a unique case of a female patient with features of classical and
  hypermobile types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) who developed complex
  scapular winging from spinal accessory and long thoracic neuropathies. These
  neurological problems became manifest after an uncomplicated total shoulder
  arthroplasty (TSA). The patient had a complex postoperative course with
  extensive work-up in addition to revision shoulder surgery and manipulations
  to treat shoulder stiffness. It was eventually suspected that the periscapular
  nerve impairments occurred during physical therapy sessions after her TSA.
  This interpretation was further supported by genetic evidence that, in
  addition to EDS, the patient had an unrecognized genetic propensity for nerve
  palsies from stretch or pressure ("hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies" (HNPP)). By two years after the TSA the neuropathies had
  only partially improved, leaving the patient with persistent scapular winging
  and shoulder weakness. With this case we alert surgeons and physical
  therapists that patients with EDS can have not only a complicated course after
  TSA, but rare concurrent conditions that can further increase the propensity
  of neurological injuries that result in compromised shoulder function.
