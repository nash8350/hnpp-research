  Pattern shift visual evoked potentials (VEPs), cervical and cortical
  somatosensory evoked responses (SEPs) and motor conduction velocities studied
  by F-wave latency measurements were investigated in two family members with
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HN-PP). In both
  cases in VEPs and SEP conduction times N13-N20 were normal. A bilateral
  pathological increase of latencies of early SEP components, N9-N13 transit
  times and F-wave latencies revealed a lesion in the proximal parts of the
  median nerves close to the spinal cord in the older patient. These
  abnormalities emphasize the close relationship of HN-PP with hereditary
  polyradiculopathy (Mayer 1975).
