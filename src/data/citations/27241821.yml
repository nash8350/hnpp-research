abstract: >-
  Lower cranial and phrenic nerve involvement is exceptional in hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). Here we report the
  occurrence of reversible laryngeal and phrenic nerve involvement in a patient
  with HNPP. The patient recalled several episodes of reversible weakness and
  numbness of his feet and hands since the age of 30 years. His medical history
  was uneventful, apart from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). At
  age 44, following severe weight loss, he presented with progressive dysphonia
  and hoarseness. EMG of cricoarytenoid and thyroarytenoid muscles and laryngeal
  fibroscopy confirmed vocal cord paralysis. These speech disturbances gradually
  regressed. Two years later, he reported rapidly worsening dyspnea.
  Electroneurography showed increased distal latency of the right phrenic nerve
  and diaphragm ultrasonography documented reduced right hemi-diaphragm
  excursion. Six months later and after optimization of CODP treatment, his
  respiratory function had improved and both phrenic nerve conduction and
  diaphragm excursion were completely restored. We hypothesize that chronic
  cough and nerve stretching in the context of CODP, together with severe weight
  loss, may have triggered the nerve paralysis in this patient. Our report
  highlights the need for optimal management of comorbidities such as CODP as
  well as careful control of weight in HNPP patients to avoid potentially
  harmful complications.
