  Hereditary neuropathy with abnormal liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is a
  dominant autosomally transmitted disease that gives rise to foci of peripheral
  nerve myelination, reducing conduction and leading to episodes of palsy and
  sensory changes that are all linked to sensitivity to pressure and traction on
  the affected nerve roots. The molecular basis of HNPP has been identified as a
  submicroscopic deletion of the 17p11.2 chromosome in exactly the same region
  that it is duplicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 1A (CMT1A). We
  report genetic analyses of 13 patients (belonging to 3 families) diagnosed of
  HNPP by means of physical examination and electrophysiologic and morphologic
  tests (the last in 3 cases only). Inter- and intrafamilial variation in
  symptomatology was studied. Some patients presented the usual clinical signs,
  such as recidivating brachial plexus palsy, permanent sensory polyneuropathy,
  foot deformities and others that might also be found in patients with CMT1A.
  All the patients showed electrophysiologic signs of underlying demyelinating
  polyneuropathy. Genetic study centered on detecting the deletion of 17p11.2 by
  segregation analysis with the polymorphic markers VAW409R3a (D17S122) and
  EW401HE (D17S61). Our results confirmed deletion at the CTM1A location of
  chromosome 17p11.2 in all 13 patients examined. These data suggest that the
  deletion of 17p11.2 plays a causal role in HNPP and that it is the most
  prevalent mutation in this disease; our findings constitute new evidence of
  the importance of the CMT1A/HNPP locus in the formation and control of
  peripheral myelin and in the ultimate functioning of peripheral nerves.
