  The modifying effect a PMP22 deletion in a family with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
  type 1 neuropathy due to an EGR2 mutation.
abstract: >-
  Mutations of both the PMP22 and EGR2 genes cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT)
  disease type 1. Deletion of the PMP22 gene, results in hereditary neuropathy
  with liability to pressure palsies. More publications exist about the
  interaction of PMP22 duplication and other CMT-causing gene mutations. In
  these cases the intrafamiliar discordant phenotypes draw the attention to the
  possible role of modifying genes. The gene-gene interactions between the PMP22
  and EGR2 genes are not well understood. We report two brothers with late onset
  CMT1 due to a c. 1142 G>A (Arg381His) heterozygous substitution in the EGR2
  gene. Additionally, the older brother with the less severe symptoms harbored
  the PMP22 gene deletion also. The coexistence of the two genetic alterations
  did not aggravate the clinical symptoms. Moreover, the PMP22 deletion appeared
  to have a beneficial modifying effect, thus implying potential gene-gene
  interaction of PMP22 and EGR2. PMP22 deletion may increase Schwann cells
  proliferation and compensate the dominant-negative effect of the Arg381 His
  substitution in the EGR2 gene.
