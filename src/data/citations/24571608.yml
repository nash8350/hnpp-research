title: Optic and auditory pathway dysfunction in demyelinating neuropathies.
abstract: >-
  The involvement of optic and auditory pathways has rarely been studied in
  demyelinating polyneuropathies. We here aimed to study this further in a
  cohort of patients with acquired and gentic demyelinating neuropathy. We
  studied eight patients with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP), six with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), ten with
  chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and seven with
  antimyelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) neuropathy using visual evoked
  potentials and brainstem auditory evoked potentials. Optic pathway dysfunction
  was detected in 6/7 anti-MAG neuropathy patients, about half of those with
  CIDP and HNPP, but only in 1/6 patients with CMT1A. Peripheral auditory nerve
  dysfunction appeared common in all groups except HNPP. Brainstem involvement
  was exceptional in all groups. We conclude optic nerve involvement may be
  frequent in all demyelinating polyneuropathies, particularly anti-MAG
  neuropathy, except in CMT1A. Peripheral auditory nerves may be spared in HNPP
  possibly due to absence of local compression. Evidence for central brainstem
  pathology appeared infrequent in all four studied neuropathies. This study
  suggests that acquired and genetic demyelinating polyneuropathies may be
  associated with optic and auditory nerve involvement, which may contribute to
  neurological disability, and require greater awareness.
