  The peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (PMP22) encodes an intrinsic membrane
  protein of compact myelin. Duplication or deletion of PMP22 causes the most
  common autosomal dominant neuropathies, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A or
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Charcot-Marie-Tooth
  disease type 1A is a hypertrophic de-remyelinating neuropathy manifesting with
  peroneal muscular atrophy and uniform, marked, slowing of nerve conduction
  velocities. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is a
  recurrent focal neuropathy with sausage-like myelin thickening (tomacula) and
  non-uniform nerve conduction velocity changes. Missense or nonsense mutations
  also cause more severe Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A forms of infancy or
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies, but they are
  presumably very rare. We performed a mutational scanning of PMP22 in 229 index
  patients (46 familial, 183 isolated) referred for suspected inherited
  neuropathy. The series included 125 cases with hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (mean age 42.5 years), 47 cases with
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (motor nerve conduction velocities at
  median nerve below 38 m/s) (mean age 40.7 years) and 57 cases with
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth with unknown nerve conduction velocities (mean age 43
  years). Preliminary molecular studies ruled out PMP22 duplication or deletion
  or mutations in a comprehensive panel of Charcot-Marie-Tooth genes. Mutational
  scanning of PMP22 was done by denaturing high performance liquid
  chromatography and automated nucleotide sequencing. To investigate the
  molecular basis of phenotype-to-genotype correlations, we performed a
  transcriptional analysis of PMP22 using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
  reaction and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in two
  phenotypically divergent nerve biopsies. Ten patients harboured eight
  micromutations of PMP22 including four novel changes. In six familial and
  three sporadic cases, detected mutations caused premature or delayed stop
  codons and were associated with hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies; the related pathological pictures ranged from classical
  tomaculous neuropathy to a mild demyelinating neuropathy with atypical
  non-tomaculous myelin thickenings. In a single family a c.179-2A> G mutation
  affecting the splice acceptor site of intron 2 cosegregated with a
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A-like syndrome and a peculiar pathological
  picture of demyelinating neuropathy without Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type
  1A-like classical onion bulbs or tomacula. Transcriptional analysis of a novel
  c.174_178 + 7delAAACGGTGAGGC deletion involving exon 2 and intron 2
  demonstrated an unstable mutant transcript leading to a p.Asn59GlyfsX12
  change; the mutation represented a null allele and caused a typical tomaculous
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. The
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1-like c.179-2A > G allele led to a stable
  transcript with an in-frame deletion of exon 3 (p.Glu60_Ala106del); the
  predicted shorter protein could exert variable molecular effects. In
  conclusion, micromutations of PMP22 cause a clinical and pathological
  continuum of demyelinating neuropathies that may include atypical phenotypes.
