abstract: >-
  Median entrapment neuropathy or carpal tunnel syndrome is uncommon in
  children. The majority of cases are related to genetic conditions which result
  in skeletal dysplasia or altered connective tissue characteristics, direct
  injury to the median nerve caused by intensive sports or trauma, or hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. This report describes a
  10-year-old patient with Alagille syndrome who presented with poor fine motor
  skills because of an entrapment neuropathy of the median nerve at the wrist.
  This condition was probably caused by intermittent external compression at the
  wrists due to years of rubbing both wrists and hands to relieve pruritus. To
  our knowledge, median neuropathy has never been associated with Alagille
  syndrome, although severe pruritus is considered a major symptom and many
  patients exhibit widespread scratching and rubbing.
