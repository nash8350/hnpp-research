  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is not a major cause
  of idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome.
abstract: >-
  Carpal tunnel syndrome is a debilitating neuropathy affecting millions of
  individuals. Although there are published reports of familial associations of
  carpal tunnel syndrome, the molecular mechanisms are unknown. To determine the
  prevalence and potential role of the chromosome 17 microdeletion associated
  with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies in patients
  diagnosed as having carpal tunnel syndrome. Prospective study. Since
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies may present as carpal
  tunnel syndrome, we evaluated 50 patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel
  syndrome for hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. No
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies deletions were
  detected. Molecular genetic testing for hereditary neuropathy with liability
  to pressure palsies in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome is of
  limited value.
