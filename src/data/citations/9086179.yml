  Studies on the effects of altered PMP22 expression during myelination in
  vitro.
abstract: >-
  Severe inherited dysmyelinating diseases of the peripheral nervous system, the
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth type1A disease (CMT1A) and the hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are associated with a large DNA
  duplication or deletion of a chromosomal region containing the peripheral
  myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. It has been suggested that a gene dosage
  effect involving PMP22 is responsible for the pathological phenotype. We
  investigated if altered PMP22 expression affects the onset of myelin formation
  and the ultrastructure of myelin. Rat Schwann cell cultures were stably
  infected with recombinant retrovirus vectors harboring the rat PMP22 cDNA in
  sense or antisense orientation. Schwann cells over- or underexpressing PMP22
  were cocultured with purified DRG neurons under conditions that promote
  myelination. We examined PMP22 expression and localization in the myelin
  forming cultures by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, and
  we analyzed myelin ultrastructure by electron microscopy. Our results
  demonstrate that abnormal levels of PMP22 expression do not impair the early
  stages of myelination and membrane compaction and do not interfere with the
  expression of other myelin genes. Our observations further indicate that PMP22
  is involved more in controlling myelin thickness and stability than in the
  events determining the initial steps of myelin formation.
