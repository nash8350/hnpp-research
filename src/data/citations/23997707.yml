title: >-
  Restless leg syndrome in different types of demyelinating neuropathies a
  single-center pilot study.
abstract: >-
  to determine the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in a cohort of
  patients with demyelinating neuropathies. Patients were retrospectively
  recruited from our cohort of different forms of demyelinating neuropathies,
  including chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP),
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1A (CMT1A), and hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP) referred to our Department of Neurology in a 10-year
  period. The validated 4-item RLS questionnaire was used for diagnosis of RLS.
  All patients with RLS who fulfilled criteria underwent a suggested
  immobilization test to confirm the diagnosis. A group of outpatients referred
  to the sleep disorders unit and data from published literature were used as
  controls. Prevalence of RLS in demyelinating neuropathy group was higher than
  prevalence observed in control population (p = 0.0142) or in the literature
  data (p = 0.0007). In particular, in comparison with both control population
  and literature data, prevalence of RLS was higher in CIDP group (p = 0.0266
  and p = 0.0063, respectively) and in CMT1A group (p = 0.0312 and p = 0.0105,
  respectively), but not in HNPP (p = 1.000 and p = 0.9320, respectively). our
  study confirms a high prevalence of RLS in inflammatory neuropathies as CIDP
  and, among inherited neuropathies, in CMT1A but not in HNPP. Considering that
  this is only a small cohort from a single-center retrospective experience, the
  link between RLS and neuropathy remains uncertain, and larger multicenter
  studies are probably needed to clarify the real meaning of the association
  between RLS and neuropathy.
