  Intraneural perineurioma is a neoplasm of perineurial cells, corresponding to
  WHO grade I. We present a case of intraneural perineurioma affecting multiple
  nerves, which usually involved one or two of major nerve trunks in one
  patient. We describe the clinical presentation, magnetic resonance (MR)
  neurography characteristics, and pathological characteristics. The
  differential diagnosis with other diseases, such as neurofibroma,
  Schwannomatosis and HNPP, will also be discussed. We also review the
  literature in efforts to highlight recent studies on intraneural perineurioma
  and heighten and awareness for the possible presentations of this disorder.
