  The CMT1A-REP repeat consists of two copies of a 24-kb sequence on human
  chromosome 17p11.2-12 that flank a 1.5-Mb region containing a dosage-sensitive
  gene, peripheral nerve protein-22 (PMP22). Unequal meiotic crossover mediated
  by misalignment of proximal and distal copies of the CMT1A-REP in humans leads
  to a 1.5-Mb duplication or deletion associated with two common peripheral
  nerve diseases, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). Previous molecular
  hybridization studies with CMT1A-REP sequences suggested that two copies of
  the repeat are also found in the chimpanzee, raising the possibility that this
  unique repeat arose during primate evolution. To further characterize the
  structure and evolutionary synthesis of the CMT1A-REP repeat, fluorescent in
  situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and heterologous PCR-based assays were
  carried out for a series of primates. Genomic DNA was analyzed with primers
  selected to differentially amplify the centromeric and telomeric ends of the
  human proximal and distal CMT1A-REP elements and an associated mariner (MLE)
  sequence. All primate species examined (common chimpanzee, pygmy chimpanzee,
  gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, baboon, rhesus monkey, green monkey, owl monkey,
  and galago) tested positive for a copy of the distal element. In addition to
  humans, only the chimpanzee was found to have a copy of the proximal CMT1A-REP
  element. All but one primate species (galago) tested positive for the MLE
  located within the CMT1A-REP sequence. These observations confirm the
  hypothesis that the distal CMT1A-REP element is the ancestral sequence which
  was duplicated during primate evolution, provide support for a
  human-chimpanzee clade, and suggest that insertion of the MLE into the
  CMT1A-REP sequence occurred in the ancestor of anthropoid primates.
