abstract: >-
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT-1A) disease results from a duplication of the
  PMP22 gene on chromosome 17p11.2. A deletion of the same region causes
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). We examined
  the expression of PMP22 in sural nerve biopsies from 2 unrelated patients with
  CMT-1A, 2 unrelated patients with HNPP, and control patients. The
  ultrastructural immunocytochemical quantitative analysis of cases of CMT-1A
  and HNPP showed, respectively, an elevated and reduced expression of PMP22
  level compared with controls.
