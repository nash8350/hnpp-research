  Clinical, neurophysiological and pathological findings of HNPP patients with
  17p12 deletion a single-centre experience.
abstract: >-
  Classic clinical manifestations of HNPP are characterized by recurrent
  painless mononeuropathies, but a minority of patients present with an atypical
  clinical pattern, including CMT-like neuropathy, acute or chronic inflammatory
  demyelinating neuropathy-like polyneuropathy, and carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Electrophysiological examination plays a central role in the diagnosis of
  HNPP, disclosing a non-uniform conduction slowing, more pronounced at
  entrapment sites. We report clinical, electrophysiological and pathological
  findings from 73 patients with HNPP, coming from 53 unrelated families,
  followed at our Institute of Neurology over a 20-year period. Typical
  presentation with recurrent multiple mononeuropathies was observed in 28/64
  (44%) patients. In the remaining 36/64 (56%), we observed an atypical clinical
  presentation, characterized by generalized weakness and cramps, chronic ulnar
  neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, chronic sensory polyneuropathy,
  Guillain-Barr√®-like presentation, and CMT-like presentation. Nine patients
  were asymptomatic for neuropathic symptoms. Nerve conduction studies showed in
  all cases a sensori-motor demyelinating polyneuropathy with conduction
  abnormalities preferentially localized at common entrapment sites. When
  performed, sural nerve biopsy disclosed the focal thickening of the myelin
  sheath in all patients. About half of the patients with HNPP from our cohort
  showed an atypical clinical presentation. Neurophysiological examination
  represents the main tool for a proper diagnosis.
