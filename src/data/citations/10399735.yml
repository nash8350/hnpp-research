  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant disorder characterised by recurrent mononeuropathies.
  Electrophysiological studies reveal slowed conduction velocity in peripheral
  nerves. The main histopathological findings are focal thickenings of
  myelin-tomaculae. In most cases HNPP is associated with a deletion within
  PMP-22 (peripheral myelin protein; PMP) gene on chromosome 17p11.2. The gene
  penetration is almost complete but the expression may be variable. DNA
  analysis is of practical importance in diagnosing HNPP especially in sporadic
  cases and also in individuals without clinical and electrophysiological signs
  of neuropathy. We present the first Polish family with HNPP, in which the
  genetic defect has been confirmed by DNA analysis.
