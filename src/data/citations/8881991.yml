  Correlation between the histopathologic, genotypic, and phenotypic features of
  hereditary peripheral neuropathies in childhood.
abstract: >-
  In recent years, there have been remarkable advances in the understanding of
  the molecular genetic basis of the hereditary polyneuropathies. Linkage of the
  genes for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease to chromosomes 1 and then 17 was
  followed by the discovery that the commonest form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth
  disease (CMT1A) was due to a duplication of DNA at 17p11.2-12. This
  duplication was shown to contain the gene for peripheral myelin protein PMP22.
  The finding that mutations of the myelin protein PMP22 gene were present in
  some Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease cases lacking the duplication confirmed the
  myelin protein PMP22 gene as the site of the defect in Charcot-Marie-Tooth
  disease. Similarly, defects of the myelin protein P0 gene on chromosome 1 have
  been demonstrated in a rarer form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT1B). A
  deletion of DNA at 17p11.2-12 results in the disorder hereditary neuropathy
  with liability to pressure palsies. Other mutations of the myelin protein
  PMP22 and myelin protein P0 genes have been associated with the clinical
  syndrome known as Dejerine-Sottas disease. An X-linked form of
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) has been characterized and shown to be due
  to mutations of the gap junction protein, connexin 32. Transgenic murine
  models with inactivated myelin protein PMP22 and myelin protein P0 genes have
  shown pathologic changes strinkingly similar to those seen in human patients
  with disturbances of those genes. In this paper, the clinical and
  histopathologic characteristics of these conditions are discussed in relation
  to the genotypic basis. It will be argued that there is still an important
  place for the clinician and nerve pathologist in a medical world immersed in
  the wonders of molecular genetics.
