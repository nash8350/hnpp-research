  d(ApGpGpCpCpT) neighboring effects and isomeric equilibria.
abstract: >-
  The intrinsic acid-base properties of the hexa-2'-deoxynucleoside
  pentaphosphate, d(ApGpGpCpCpT) [=(A1∙G2∙G3∙C4∙C5∙T6)=(HNPP)⁵⁻] have been
  determined by ¹H NMR shift experiments. The pKa values of the individual sites
  of the adenosine (A), guanosine (G), cytidine (C), and thymidine (T) residues
  were measured in water under single-strand conditions (i.e., 10% D₂O, 47 °C,
  I=0.1 M, NaClO₄). These results quantify the release of H⁺ from the two (N7)H⁺
  (G∙G), the two (N3)H⁺ (C∙C), and the (N1)H⁺ (A) units, as well as from the two
  (N1)H (G∙G) and the (N3)H (T) sites. Based on measurements with
  2'-deoxynucleosides at 25 °C and 47 °C, they were transferred to pKa values
  valid in water at 25 °C and I=0.1 M. Intramolecular stacks between the
  nucleobases A1 and G2 as well as most likely also between G2 and G3 are
  formed. For HNPP three pKa clusters occur, that is those encompassing the pKa
  values of 2.44, 2.97, and 3.71 of G2(N7)H⁺, G3(N7)H⁺, and A1(N1)H⁺,
  respectively, with overlapping buffer regions. The tautomer populations were
  estimated, giving for the release of a single proton from five-fold protonated
  H₅(HNPP)(±) , the tautomers (G2)N7, (G3)N7, and (A1)N1 with formation degrees
  of about 74, 22, and 4%, respectively. Tautomer distributions reveal pathways
  for proton-donating as well as for proton-accepting reactions both being
  expected to be fast and to occur practically at no "cost". The eight pKa
  values for H₅(HNPP)(±) are compared with data for nucleosides and nucleotides,
  revealing that the nucleoside residues are in part affected very differently
  by their neighbors. In addition, the intrinsic acidity constants for the RNA
  derivative r(A1∙G2∙G3∙C4∙C5∙U6), where U=uridine, were calculated. Finally,
  the effect of metal ions on the pKa values of nucleobase sites is briefly
  discussed because in this way deprotonation reactions can easily be shifted to
  the physiological pH range.
