  Persisting "writer's cramp" as a result of compensation of a temporary palsy
  due to a hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.
abstract: >-
  A 49-year-old man reported several periods of acute paresis of different
  nerves after exposure to pressure. All palsies showed a good recovery over a
  period of days to months. The suspected diagnosis of a hereditary neuropathy
  with liability to pressure palsies was confirmed by the histology of a suralis
  nerve biopsy, which showed a distinct tomaculous swelling of the myelin. Nine
  years ago he noticed an acute, distally pronounced palsy of the right arm. A
  brachial plexus lesion was diagnosed. His profession required written work,
  thereby forcing him to compensate this weakness by increasing the coactivation
  of the elbow and upper arm. This coactivation persisted even after complete
  recovery from the plexus palsy. Thus, the patient showed the typical feature
  of classical writer's cramp, with broad coactivation of the arm muscles, which
  has continued to the present. At the same time, however, the patient was able
  to perform other motoric tasks well, such as painting. After several practice
  sessions with a special program that makes use of preserved motor abilities to
  reestablish writing, the patient was again able to write with a normal
  kinematic profile as documented by the recorded handwriting. This suggests
  that the "writer's cramp" of our patient is one form of task-related dystonia
  that may be related more to the perserveration of a misleading motor strategy
  than to a general inability of the motor system to control the movement
  properly.
