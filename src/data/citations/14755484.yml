  Loss-of-function phenotype of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) provides a
  human model to investigate the role of PMP22 in myelinated peripheral nerve,
  since the disease is caused by a deletion of one of the two PMP22 alleles. To
  systematically characterize the phenotype of HNPP, we prospectively evaluated
  the clinical features and electrophysiological findings in 17 genetically
  confirmed patients, 7 men and 10 women, ranging in age from 9 to 66 years
  (mean, 41 +/- 13). Fifteen symptomatic patients presented with episodes of
  transient focal weakness or sensory loss that were usually related to
  particular activities causing nerve compression, including stretching or minor
  repetitive focal trauma. No patient sought medical attention for symptoms of a
  symmetric polyneuropathy. Neurological examinations were either normal or
  mildly abnormal. Neither focal slowing of nerve conduction studies, nor
  reduction in compound muscle action potential (CMAP) or sensory nerve action
  potential (SNAP) amplitudes consistently predicted the site of symptoms. We
  conclude that the majority of patients with HNPP present with transient,
  recurrent, focal symptoms of weakness or sensory loss in the distribution of
  individual nerves or plexus, and that a diffuse symmetric sensorimotor
  polyneuropathy is an unusual presentation of HNPP. These studies suggest that
  the function of PMP22, at least in part, is to stabilize myelin so that it
  will be protected from injuries resulting from repetitive, minor trauma.
