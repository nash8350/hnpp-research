  An estimation of the prevalence of genomic disorders using chromosomal
  microarray data.
abstract: >-
  Multiple genomic disorders result from recurrent deletions or duplications
  between low copy repeat (LCR) clusters, mediated by nonallelic homologous
  recombination. These copy number variants (CNVs) often exhibit variable
  expressivity and/or incomplete penetrance. However, the population prevalence
  of many genomic disorders has not been estimated accurately. A subset of
  genomic disorders similarly characterized by CNVs between LCRs have been
  studied epidemiologically, including Williams-Beuren syndrome (7q11.23),
  Smith-Magenis syndrome (17p11.2), velocardiofacial syndrome (22q11.21),
  Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes (15q11.2q12), 17q12 deletion syndrome, and
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 1/hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsy (PMP22, 17q11.2). We have generated a method to estimate
  prevalence of highly penetrant genomic disorders by (1) leveraging
  epidemiological data for genomic disorders with previously reported prevalence
  estimates, (2) obtaining chromosomal microarray data on genomic disorders from
  a large medical genetics clinic; and (3) utilizing these in a linear
  regression model to determine the prevalence of this syndromic copy number
  change among the general population. Using our algorithm, the prevalence for
  five clinically relevant recurrent genomic disorders 1q21.1 microdeletion
  (1/6882 live births) and microduplication syndromes (1/6309), 15q13.3
  microdeletion syndrome (1/5525), and 16p11.2 microdeletion (1/3021) and
  microduplication syndromes (1/4216), were determined. These findings will
  inform epidemiological strategies for evaluating those conditions, and our
  method may be useful to evaluate the prevalence of other highly penetrant
  genomic disorders.
