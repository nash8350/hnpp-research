  Significant progress in the understanding of the molecular genetics and
  pathophysiology of inherited neuropathies has been achieved during the last
  years. The causative genetic defects of most of the demyelinating forms are
  known and different chromosomal loci have been identified for the rarer axonal
  forms. Mutations in genes encoding the myelin proteins peripheral myelin
  protein 22, myelin protein zero and connection 32 are associated with
  hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type I and II and hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Transgenic animals have been
  generated allowing new insights in the pathophysiology of the diseases. The
  understanding of the cellular mechanisms leading to hereditary neuropathies
  will contribute to the development of effective therapeutic strategies.
