  Sporadic cases of hereditary neuropathies are not uncommon. The most frequent
  clinical pictures are purely or predominantly motor neuropathies. A hereditary
  neuropathy of Charcot-Marie-Tooth should be suspected in the following
  situations presence of scoliosis and pes cavus, distal weakness with forearm
  and leg distal muscle atrophy, discrepancy between relatively mild motor
  deficit and severe atrophy or markedly reduced spatial recruitment on needle
  EMG examination, severely altered sensory nerve action potentials with subtle
  sensory symptoms and, in the demyelinating type, homogenous slowing of nerve
  conduction in distal and proximal segments (normal terminal latency index),
  and between nerves of a same region or between axons of the same nerve
  (absence of temporal dispersion). Amyloid neuropathy should be considered in
  case of axonal sensori-motor polyneuropathy of subacute course, with autonomic
  dysfunction, plantar ulcers and/or subclinical carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies usually gives a
  picture of multifocal neuropathy with nerve conduction slowing at usual
  compression sites. Finally, purely sensory hereditary neuropathies are rare
  and seldom cause diagnostic problems.
