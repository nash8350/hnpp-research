  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies occurring during

abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal-dominant peripheral neuropathy characterized by recurrent isolated
  nerve palsies, which are precipitated by trivial compression and trauma.
  Although HNPP has been well-described in literature, it often goes
  unrecognized. We report a case of HNPP occurring during military training to
  promote recognition and proper management of this entity.
