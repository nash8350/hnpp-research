  A duplication of a 1.5-Megabase genomic region encompassing the gene for the
  peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) is found on chromosome 17p11.2-12 in
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), whereas the reciprocal deletion
  is associated with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  (HNPP). Since most CMT1A patients harbor three copies of the PMP22 gene, and
  most HNPP patients carry only a single copy, a gene dosage effect has been
  proposed as a mechanism for both diseases. We have analyzed the steady-state
  expression of PMP22 protein in sural nerve biopsies from three CMT1A and four
  HNPP patients. Quantitative immunohistochemical determination showed that
  PMP22 protein expression relative to that of myelin protein zero and myelin
  basic protein was increased in all CMT1A patients and reduced in all HNPP
  patients, as compared with biopsy samples of patients with normal PMP22 gene
  expression. These data demonstrate that both neuropathies result from an
  imbalance of PMP22 protein expression.
