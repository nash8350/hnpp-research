  A population-based epidemiologic study of adult neuromuscular disease in the
  Republic of Ireland.
abstract: >-
  To estimate the prevalence rates (PRs) of acquired and inherited neuromuscular
  diseases (NMD) in the adult Irish population, reflecting the burden of these
  conditions in a single country. This population-based study was performed in
  the Republic of Ireland (RoI), with a PR estimated for December 2013. Multiple
  case ascertainment sources were utilized. Demographic and clinical information
  and relevant diagnostic results were registered. A total of 2,641 adults were
  identified, giving a PR of 62.6/100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI]
  59.95-65.24) for all NMD in RoI. Disease-specific PR include chronic
  inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy 5.87/100,000 (95% CI
  5.06-6.68), Charcot-Marie-Tooth 10.52/100,000 (95% CI 9.44-11.61), hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies 0.84/100,000 (95% CI 0.54-1.15),
  myotonic dystrophy type I 6.75/100,000 (95% CI 5.88-7.61), Duchenne muscular
  dystrophy 3.0/100,000 (95% CI 2.33-3.70), Becker muscular dystrophy
  2.2/100,000 (95% CI 1.64-2.88), facioscapulohumeral dystrophy 2.59/100,000
  (95% CI 2.05-3.13), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2.88/100,000 (95% CI
  2.31-3.45), periodic paralysis 1.72/100,000 (95% CI 1.28-2.15), myotonia
  congenita 0.32/100,000 (95% CI 0.18-0.56), paramyotonia congenita 0.15/100,000
  (95% CI 0.06-0.34), Kennedy disease 0.83/100,000 (95% CI 0.40-1.27),
  Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome 0.29/100,000 (95% CI 0.11-0.47), myasthenia
  gravis 15.12/100,000 (95% CI 13.82-16.42), and sporadic inclusion body
  myositis 11.7/100,000 (95% CI 9.82-13.58). PR for amyotrophic lateral
  sclerosis was established from an existing Register as 7.20/100,000 (95% CI
  6.34-8.15). The PR of all adult NMD in RoI is relatively high when compared
  with other chronic neurologic disorders, although some figures may be an
  underestimate of the true prevalence. The data provide a framework for
  international comparison and service planning.
