  Soon after the description of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) in 1886, it
  became apparent that this syndrome is clinically and genetically
  heterogeneous. Neuropathological and electrophysiological studies have further
  dissected this syndrome into distinct categories that are now classified in a
  complex nosology of the inherited peripheral neuropathies. The recent advent
  of molecular genetics has dramatically increased our understanding of the
  underlying disease mechanisms. Genetic linkage studies have identified at
  least 17 genetic loci for different types of inherited neuropathies although
  most genes involved still remain to be found. The application of molecular
  genetics has already had an important impact on clinical practice and genetic
  counselling. Three genes responsible for hereditary motor and sensory
  neuropathy type I (HMSNI) or CMT1 have been identified peripheral myelin
  protein 22 (PMP22) and myelin protein zero (MPZ) for the autosomal dominant
  form and connexin 32 (Cx32) for the X-linked dominant variant. The PMP22 gene
  is also involved in the majority of families with hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). The observation of a 1.5 Mb tandem
  duplication in chromosome 17p11.2, containing the PMP22 gene, in CMT1 and the
  reciprocal deletion in the same region in HNPP has provided a novel disease
  paradigm for autosomal dominant disorders, i.e. the gene dosage mechanism. The
  study of phenotype-genotype correlations in transgenic animal models for
  PMP22, MPZ and Cx32 mutations will help elucidate the underlying disease
  mechanisms and will provide a basis for gene therapy and/or other therapeutic
  approaches such as treatment with neurotrophic growth factors.
