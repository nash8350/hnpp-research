title: Intranervous regeneration. The study of motor axon reflexes.
abstract: >-
  More than 1000 motor axon reflexes (ARs) have been studied. The AR often has a
  long latency and the first excited branch almost always has the fastest
  conduction velocity. Sometimes the potentials of the two branches are recorded
  at the same needle placement, giving the appearance in the EMG tracing of a
  coupling discharge. Stimulation of the axons in the muscle produces more ARs
  than stimulation of the nerve trunk. ARs are recorded in denervated muscles
  but never in normal subjects. All kinds of lower motor neuron lesions produce
  ARs. They are more frequent in the Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome and hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies where the axonal lesions are
  mainly located at the traditional sites of entrapment. The possibility of
  neurolysis in some of these cases has to be considered. Obstetrical brachial
  plexus palsies furnish many ARs linking two muscles, thus explaining the
  associated contractions in these cases.
