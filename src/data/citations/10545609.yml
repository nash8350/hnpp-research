  Rearrangements in 17p11.2, responsible for the 1.5 Mb duplications and
  deletions associated, respectively, with autosomal dominant
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A disease (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are a suitable model for studying human
  recombination. Rearrangements in 17p11.2 are caused by unequal crossing-over
  between two homologous 24 kb sequences, the CMT1A-REPs, that flank the disease
  locus and occur in most cases within a 1.7 kb hotspot. We sequenced this
  hotspot in 28 de novo patients (25 CMT1A and three HNPP), in order to localize
  precisely, at the DNA sequence level, the crossing-overs. We show that some
  chimeric CMT1A-REPs in de novo patients (10/28) present conversion of DNA
  segments associated with the crossing-over. These rearrangements can be
  explained by the double-strand break (DSB) repair model described in yeast.
  Fine mapping of the de novo rearrangements provided evidence that the
  successive steps of this model, heteroduplex DNA formation, mismatch
  correction and gene conversion, occurred in patients. Furthermore, the model
  explains 17p11.2 recombinations between chromosome homologues as well as
  between sister chromatids. In addition, defective mismatch repair of the
  heteroduplex DNA, observed in two patients, resulted in two heterozygous
  chimeric CMT1A-REPs which can be explained, as in yeast, by post-meiotic
  segregation. This work supports the hypothesis that the DSB repair model of
  DNA exchange may apply universally from yeasts to humans.
