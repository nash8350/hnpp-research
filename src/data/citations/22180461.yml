abstract: >-
  Myelin insulates axons in the peripheral nervous system to allow rapid
  propagation of action potentials, and proper myelination requires the precise
  regulation of genes encoding myelin proteins, including PMP22. The correct
  gene dosage of PMP22 is critical; a duplication of PMP22 is the most common
  cause of the peripheral neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT)
  (classified as type 1A), while a deletion of PMP22 leads to another peripheral
  neuropathy, hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.
  Recently, duplications upstream of PMP22, but not containing the gene itself,
  were reported in patients with CMT1A like symptoms, suggesting that this
  region contains regulators of PMP22. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation
  analysis of two transcription factors known to upregulate PMP22-EGR2 and
  SOX10-we found several enhancers in this upstream region that contain open
  chromatin and direct reporter gene expression in tissue culture and in vivo in
  zebrafish. These studies provide a novel means to identify critical regulatory
  elements in genes that are required for myelination, and elucidate the
  functional significance of non-coding genomic rearrangements.
