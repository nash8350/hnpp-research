abstract: >-
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is the commonest hereditary neuropathy
  encompassing a large group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous
  disorders. The commonest form of CMT, CMT1A, is usually caused by a 1.4
  megabase duplication of chromosome 17 containing the PMP22 gene. Mutations of
  PMP22 are a less common cause of CMT. We describe clinical,
  electrophysiological and molecular findings of 10 patients carrying PMP22
  missense mutations. The phenotype varied from mild hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) to severe CMT1. We identified six
  different point mutations, including two novel mutations. Three families were
  also found to harbour a Thr118Met mutation. Although PMP22 point mutations are
  not common, our findings highlight the importance of sequencing the PMP22 gene
  in patients with variable CMT phenotypes and also confirm that the PMP22
  Thr118Met mutation is associated with a neuropathy albeit with reduced
  penetrance.
