  Detection of two different mRNAs in a single section by dual in situ
  hybridization a comparison between colorimetric and fluorescent detection.
abstract: >-
  We have compared the performance of two methods designed to simultaneously
  detect two different mRNAs within a single brain section by dual ISH. Specific
  mRNA riboprobes labeled with biotin and digoxigenin were simultaneously
  hybridized and visualized using either brightfield or fluorescence microscopy.
  For brightfield visualization, the biotin-labeled riboprobe was detected with
  a peroxidase chromogen, whereas, an alkaline phosphatase substrate was used
  for the detection of the digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe. Dual fluorescent ISH
  involved the detection of the biotin-labeled riboprobe with an
  Alexa((R))488-conjugated streptavidin followed by the visualization of the
  digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe with the red fluorescent substrate HNPP. The
  dual ISH protocols presented here offer sensitive methods to detect the
  expression of two mRNAs of interest, with both colorimetric and fluorescent
  ISH each having its strengths and limitations. For example, dual colorimetric
  ISH has proven to be particularly useful to study the distribution of two
  mRNAs in different brain nuclei, whereas, dual fluorescent ISH has provided
  better results when studying the co-localization of two different mRNAs in
  single neurons. The comprehensive step-by-step procedure is presented,
  together with a troubleshooting section in which the advantages and
  limitations of these procedures are reviewed in depth. Moreover, alternative
  protocols for dual ISH were also compared to those presented here.
