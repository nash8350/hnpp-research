  An Unusual Postoperative Neuropathy Foot Drop Contralateral to the Lateral
  Decubitus Position.
abstract: >-
  Postoperative neuropathy is often related to surgical positioning or improper
  padding during surgery. However, other causes should be considered,
  particularly when the deficit does not correlate with a positioning error. A
  case is presented of a 15-year-old girl who experienced postoperative foot
  drop contralateral to the lateral decubitus position. Further evaluation led
  to a clinical diagnosis of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies that predisposed the patient to the injury. Anesthesiologists should
  suspect hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies in patients
  presenting for multiple nerve decompression surgeries and be vigilant in the
  perioperative handling of these susceptible individuals.
