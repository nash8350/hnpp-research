  Recombination between repeated sequences at various loci of the human genome
  are known to give rise to DNA rearrangements associated with many genetic
  disorders. Perhaps the most extensively characterized genomic region prone to
  rearrangement is 17p12, which is associated with the peripheral neuropathies,
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) and
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A;ref. 2). Homologous recombination
  between 24-kb flanking repeats, termed CMT1A-REPs, results in a 1.5-Mb
  deletion that is associated with HNPP, and the reciprocal duplication product
  is associated with CMT1A (ref. 2). Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a multiple
  congenital anomalies, mental retardation syndrome associated with a chromosome
  17 microdeletion, del(17)(p11.2p11.2) (ref. 3,4). Most patients (>90%) carry
  deletions of the same genetic markers and define a common deletion. We report
  seven unrelated patients with de novo duplications of the same region deleted
  in SMS. A unique junction fragment, of the same apparent size, was identified
  in each patient by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Further molecular
  analyses suggest that the de novo17p11.2 duplication is preferentially
  paternal in origin, arises from unequal crossing over due to homologous
  recombination between flanking repeat gene clusters and probably represents
  the reciprocal recombination product of the SMS deletion. The clinical
  phenotype resulting from duplication [dup(17)(p11.2p11.2)] is milder than that
  associated with deficiency of this genomic region. This mechanism of
  reciprocal deletion and duplication via homologous recombination may not only
  pertain to the 17p11.2 region, but may also be common to other regions of the
  genome where interstitial microdeletion syndromes have been defined.
