title: 'Sonography of the median nerve in CMT1A, CMT2A, CMTX, and HNPP.'
abstract: >-
  In this study we compare the ultrasound features in the median nerve in
  patients with different types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease and
  hereditary neuropathies with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) as a typical
  entrapment neuropathy. Median nerve ultrasound and conduction studies were
  performed in patients with CMT1A (n = 12), MFN2-associated CMT2A (n = 7), CMTX
  (n = 5), and HNPP (n = 5), and in controls (n = 28). Median nerve
  cross-sectional area (CSA) was significantly increased in CMT1A, whereas, in
  axonal CMT2A, fascicle diameter (FD) was enlarged. CSA correlated with nerve
  conduction slowing in CMT1A and with axonal loss, as shown by motor and
  sensory nerve amplitudes in both CMT1A and CMT2A. A relatively low
  wrist-to-forearm-ratio (WFR <0.8) or a relatively high WFR (>1.8) appeared to
  be unlikely in MFN2 and Cx32 mutations of CMT2A and CMTX, respectively.
  Differences in CSA, FD, and WFR of the median nerve can be helpful in defining
  subtypes of hereditary neuropathies.
