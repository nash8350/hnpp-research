  We report the clinical and electrophysiologic characteristics of eight
  patients (four men and four women) with a hereditary neuropathy with probable
  thermosensitivity (HTN) of autosomal dominant inheritance. Patients presented
  reversible episodes of ascending muscle weakness, paresthesiae, and areflexia
  apparently triggered by an elevation of body temperature over 38.5 degrees C.
  Mean age at onset was 13 +/- 12 (SD; range 6 to 43). Four patients had
  suffered up to five attacks. EMG and pathologic findings were compatible with
  a reversible demyelinating neuropathy such as Guillain-Barr√© syndrome. We
  excluded loci causing other hereditary demyelinating neuropathies, such as
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type I (CMT type I) and hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), by linkage analysis; thus, HTN is not
  allelic to either CMT type I or to HNPP.
