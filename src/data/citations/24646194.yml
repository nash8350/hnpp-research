  PMP22 related neuropathies comprise (1) PMP22 duplications leading to
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), (2) PMP22 deletions, leading to
  Hereditary Neuropathy with liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP), and (3) PMP22
  point mutations, causing both phenotypes. Overall prevalence of CMT is usually
  reported as 12,500, epidemiological studies show that 20-64% of CMT patients
  carry the PMP22 duplication. The prevalence of HNPP is not well known. CMT1A
  usually presents in the first two decades with difficulty walking or running.
  Distal symmetrical muscle weakness and wasting and sensory loss is present,
  legs more frequently and more severely affected than arms. HNPP typically
  leads to episodic, painless, recurrent, focal motor and sensory peripheral
  neuropathy, preceded by minor compression on the affected nerve.
  Electrophysiological evaluation is needed to determine whether the
  polyneuropathy is demyelinating. Sonography of the nerves can be useful.
  Diagnosis is confirmed by finding respectively a PMP22 duplication, deletion
  or point mutation. Differential diagnosis includes other inherited
  neuropathies, and acquired polyneuropathies. The mode of inheritance is
  autosomal dominant and de novo mutations occur. Offspring of patients have a
  chance of 50% to inherit the mutation from their affected parent. Prenatal
  testing is possible; requests for prenatal testing are not common. Treatment
  is currently symptomatic and may include management by a rehabilitation
  physician, physiotherapist, occupational therapist and orthopaedic surgeon.
  Adult CMT1A patients show slow clinical progression of disease, which seems to
  reflect a process of normal ageing. Life expectancy is normal.
