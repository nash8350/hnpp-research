  Frequency of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP)
  due to 17p11.2 deletion in a Korean newborn population.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant disorder mainly due to a deletion of chromosome 17p11.2
  including PMP22 (PMP22 Del HNPP). The prevalence of HNPP is estimated to be
  0.84 to 16 per 100,000, but could be underestimated because of the mild
  symptoms of HNPP. In this study, we estimated the prevalence of PMP22 Del HNPP
  in a Korean newborn population who underwent next-generation sequencing
  (NGS)-based copy number variation (CNV) analysis. Of the 11,885 newborns
  tested by NGS-based CNV analysis, 17p11.2 deletions were found in seven
  samples. The prevalence of PMP22 Del HNPP was estimated to be 58.9 per 100,000
  (95% confidence interval (CI), 25.8-116.5) or 1 in 1698 (95% CI,
  1/909-1/5000). Our data suggest that PMP22 Del HNPP might not be uncommon at
  least in the Korean population.
