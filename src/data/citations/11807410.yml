  A number of human hereditary neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders are
  caused by the expansion of trinucleotide repeats within certain genes. The
  molecular mechanisms that underlie these expansions are not yet known. We have
  analyzed six trinucleotide repeat-containing loci [spinocerebellar ataxias
  (SCA1, SCA3, SCA8), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), Huntington
  chorea (HD) and fragile X syndrome (FRAXA)] in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)
  patients (n = 52). As controls, we analyzed two groups of subjects healthy
  control subjects (n =133), and a group of patients with non-triplet
  neuromuscular diseases (n = 68) caused by point mutations, deletions or
  duplications (spinal muscular atrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 1A,
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies, and Duchenne and
  Becker muscular dystrophy). Allele frequency distributions for all tested loci
  were similar in these three groups with the exception of the SCA1 locus. In
  DM1 patients, the SCA1 allele with 31 CAG repeats account for 40.4% of all
  chromosomes tested, which is significantly higher than in two other groups
  (11.3% in healthy controls and 6.6% in the group of non-triplet diseased
  patients; P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). This is consistent with our
  previous findings in HD patients. The absence of this association in
  non-triplet diseases as well as in healthy controls could indicate a possible
  role of this SCA1 allele with 31 repeats in triplet diseases. Here we discuss
  a possible role of the SCA1 region in pathological trinucleotide repeat
  expansions.
