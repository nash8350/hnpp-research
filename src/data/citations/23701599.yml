  High resolution sonography in the evaluation of the peripheral nervous system
  in polyneuropathy--a review of the literature.
abstract: >-
  Clinical, laboratory and electrodiagnostic studies are the mainstay in the
  diagnosis of polyneuropathy. An accurate etiological diagnosis is of paramount
  importance to provide the appropriate treatment, prognosis and genetic
  counselling. High resolution sonography of the peripheral nervous system
  allows nerves to be readily visualized and to assess their morphology.
  Ultrasonography has brought pathophysiological insights and substantially
  added to diagnostic accuracy and treatment decisions amongst mononeuropathies.
  In this study the literature on its clinical application in polyneuropathy is
  reviewed. Several polyneuropathies have been studied by means of ultrasound
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth, hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies,
  chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome,
  multifocal motor neuropathy, paraneoplastic polyneuropathy, leprosy and
  diabetic neuropathy. The most prominent reported pathological changes were
  nerve enlargement, increased hypo-echogenicity and increased intraneural
  vascularization. Sonography revealed intriguingly different patterns of nerve
  enlargement between inflammatory neuropathies and axonal and inherited
  polyneuropathies. However, many studies concerned case reports or case series
  and showed methodological shortcomings. Further prospective studies with
  standardized protocols for nerve sonography and clinical and electrodiagnostic
  testing are needed to determine the role of nerve sonography in inherited and
  acquired polyneuropathies.
