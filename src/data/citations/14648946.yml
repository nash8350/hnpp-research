  Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is rarely seen in children. A literature search
  in 1989 revealed 52 published cases. The authors review 163 additional cases
  that were published since that date. The majority of these cases were related
  with a genetic condition. The most common aetiology was lysosomal storage
  disease mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) in 95 and mucolipidoses (ML) in 22. In CTS
  secondary to MPS, clinical signs typical of adult CTS are rarely seen, and
  difficulty with fine motor tasks is the most frequent finding. CTS in MPS does
  not seem to be prevented by bone marrow transplantation, the usual treatment
  for the condition. CTS is probably due to a combination of excessive lysosomal
  storage in the connective tissue of the flexor retinaculum and a distorted
  anatomy because of underlying bone dysplasia. Mucolipidoses come next in the
  aetiology, with essentially similar symptoms. The authors found in the
  literature 11 cases of primary familial CTS, a condition which presents as an
  inheritable disorder of connective tissue mediated by an autosomal dominant
  gene; the symptoms may be more typical in some cases, but are more similar to
  MPS in others. A case with self-mutilation has been reported. Hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is a rare autosomal
  dominant condition characterised by episodes of decreased sensation or palsies
  after slight traction or pressure on peripheral nerves; it may also give
  symptoms of CTS. Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS), another genetic disorder with
  autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia, is characterised by varying degrees of
  myotonia and chondrodysplasia; it has also been noted associated with CTS in a
  child. Melorrheostosis and Leri's syndrome have also been noted in children
  with CTS, as well as DÃ©jerine-Sottas syndrome and Weill-Marchesani syndrome.
  Among non-genetic causes of CTS in children, idiopathic cases with children
  onset have been reported, usually but not always related with thickening of
  the transverse carpal ligament. Intensive sports practice has been reported as
  an aetiological factor in several cases of childhood CTS. Nerve territory
  oriented macrodactily, a benign localised form of gigantism, is another
  unusual cause of CTS in children, as are fibrolipomas of the median nerve or
  intraneural perineuroma or haemangioma of the median nerve. Acute cases have
  been reported in children with haemophilia, secondary to local bleeding.
  Another local cause is a musculotendinous malformation of the palmaris longus,
  the flexor digitorum superficialis, the flexor carpi radialis brevis (a
  supernumerary muscle), the first lumbricalis or the palmaris brevis. Isolated
  cases of childhood CTS have also been reported in Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome,
  in Poland's syndrome and in scleroderma. Finally, several cases have been
  noted following trauma, most often related with epiphysiolysis of the distal
  radius. Immediate reduction has cleared the problem in most cases, but
  exploration of the median nerve should be considered otherwise, and also in
  cases with delayed occurrence of symptoms. Overall 145 of the 163 reviewed
  cases have undergone open carpal tunnel release. Childhood CTS often has an
  unusual presentation, with modest complaints and children are often too young
  to communicate their problem. In CTS with specific aetiologies such as storage
  disease, the symptoms may be masked by the skeletal dysplasia and joint
  stiffness. Every child with even mild symptoms must be thoroughly examined and
  a family history must be taken. Children with storage disease may benefit from
  early clinical and electrophysiological screening before they develop obvious
  clinical signs.
