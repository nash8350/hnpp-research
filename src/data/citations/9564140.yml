title: '[Recurrent palsies--consider hereditary pressure neuropathy!].'
abstract: >-
  Three cases of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  (HNPP), characterised by the typical deletion in chromosome 17p11 2-12, are
  described in the article. The clinical manifestations were pain-free brachial
  plexus palsies in two patients (belonging to the same family), and multiple
  episodes of numbness and weakness in various nerves in the third patient. The
  clinical, electrophysiological, histological and genetic findings are
  reviewed.
