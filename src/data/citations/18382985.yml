  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant nerve disease usually caused by 1,5 Mb deletion on
  chromosome 17p11.2.2-p12, the region where the PMP-22 gene is located. The
  patients with HNPP usually have relapsing and remitting entrapment
  neuropathies due to compression. We present a 14-year-old male who had acute
  onset, right-sided ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow. He had
  electrophysiological findings of bilateral ulnar nerve entrapments (more
  severe at the right side) at the elbow and bilateral median nerve entrapment
  at the wrist. Genetic tests of the patient demonstrated deletions in the
  17p11.2 region. The patient underwent decompressive surgery for ulnar nerve
  entrapment at the elbow and completely recovered two months after the event.
  Although HNPP is extremely rare, it should be taken into consideration in
  young adults with entrapment neuropathies.
