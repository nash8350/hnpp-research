  The diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and related neuropathies
  (e. g. Déjèrine-Sottas disease; hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies) appears to be easy. However, the incredible advances in
  molecular genetics have greatly complicated the classification of these
  disorders, and the proper diagnosis of the CMT subtype may be important for
  correct genetic counselling and prognosis. Moreover, these diseases may be
  confused with potentially treatable acquired and inherited neuropathies, such
  as dysimmune neuropathies, familial amyloid polyneuropathy, and Refsum's
  disease. A number of clinical, laboratory, electrophysiological, morphological
  and neuroradiological features that may help in the diagnostic process are
  reviewed in the present paper. DNA investigations are fundamental but need to
  be properly addressed. Currently, great interest is focused on the role of the
  immune system in hereditary neuropathies, and surprising findings are coming
  from research on animal models.
