  Mononeuropathy after surgery may occur and hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies is a possible pathological condition related to
  paresis after hip surgery. We present a case of 66-year-old man presenting
  severe weakness at inferior limb muscles after hip prosthesis revision. Clinic
  and electrophysiology showed severe right fibular nerve damage and ultrasound
  found a marked enlargement of the same nerve, associated with focal
  enlargements in other nerves. A diagnosis of hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies was suspected and confirmed by genetic test. The
  patient gradually recovered returning to a normal daily active life.
  Ultrasound was crucial for diagnosis. The suspicion and diagnosis of latent
  neuropathy, which can occur after surgical intervention, may lead to a better
  understand of the risks of the surgery, specific for the patient, and avoid
  the wrong attribution to surgical malpractice.
