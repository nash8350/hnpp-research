  Family with inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and the HNPP 17p12
  deletion.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), classically
  presenting as recurrent focal neuropathies precipitated by trauma or
  compression, is an autosomal dominant neuropathy due to a deletion at
  chromosomal locus 17p12. Inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (IDP), a
  putative autoimmune disorder presenting in an acute (AIDP) or a chronic form
  (CIDP), has been rarely reported as familial. We present a father and two
  daughters of Jewish Kurdish origin who developed IDP within 10 years. The
  unusual familial history led us to reevaluate the diagnosis of IDP, and
  suggested an autosomal dominant pedigree. DNA analysis identified the deletion
  typical of HNPP on chromosome 17. Screening for the HNPP deletion in patients
  with atypical, recurrent, or familial IDP might be warranted.
