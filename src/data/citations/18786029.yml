title: An improved in situ hybridization method for the detection of fish pathogens.
abstract: >-
  A fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) method was developed for detection
  of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) in paraffin-embedded tissues of
  Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L. Several methods of probe labelling and
  detection were evaluated and found unsuitable for FISH because of tissue
  autofluorescence. Likewise, the use of avidin to detect biotin-labelled probe
  was obviated by the presence of endogenous biotin. An existing approach, using
  digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled probes and detection by anti-DIG antibody-labelled
  with alkaline phosphatase, was modified to use a fluorescent substrate,
  2-hydroxy-3-naphthoic acid-2'-phenylanilide phosphate/4-chloro-2-methylbenzene
  diazonium hemi-zinc chloride salt (HNPP/Fast Red TR). This improved method
  allowed sensitive detection of IPNV target, without interference from
  autofluorescence or endogenous alkaline phosphatase. Furthermore, the reporter
  produces a discrete, non-fading signal, which is particularly suitable for
  analysis by confocal microscopy.
