  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant polyneuropathy usually caused by a deletion in the gene
  coding for the peripheral nerve myelin protein 22 (PMP22). The patients
  usually get relapsing and remitting focal nerve symptoms due to mechanical
  factors like pressure or minor trauma that normal nerves tolerate. Two
  patients from different families have been examined clinically,
  neurophysiologically and genetically by Southern blot and PCR techniques. The
  clinical and neurophysiological findings were typical of this disorder, and
  the DNA tests showed deletions in the PMP22 gene. We discuss clinical,
  neurophysiological and molecular diagnostics, pathomechanisms, treatment and
  secondary prevention. Early diagnosis may be important for optimal management
  of the patients.
