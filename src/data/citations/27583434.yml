  Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous systems extend their membranes to wrap
  axons concentrically and form the insulating sheath, called myelin. The spaces
  between layers of myelin are sealed by myelin junctions. This tight insulation
  enables rapid conduction of electric impulses (action potentials) through
  axons. Demyelination (stripping off the insulating sheath) has been widely
  regarded as one of the most important mechanisms altering the action potential
  propagation in many neurological diseases. However, the effective nerve
  conduction is also thought to require a proper myelin seal through myelin
  junctions such as tight junctions and adherens junctions. In the present
  study, we have demonstrated the disruption of myelin junctions in a mouse
  model (Pmp22+/-) of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  (HNPP) with heterozygous deletion of Pmp22 gene. We observed a robust increase
  of F-actin in Pmp22+/- nerve regions where myelin junctions were disrupted,
  leading to increased myelin permeability. These abnormalities were present
  long before segmental demyelination at the late phase of Pmp22+/- mice.
  Moreover, the increase of F-actin levels correlated with an enhanced activity
  of p21-activated kinase (PAK1), a molecule known to regulate actin
  polymerization. Pharmacological inhibition of PAK normalized levels of
  F-actin, and completely prevented the progression of the myelin junction
  disruption and nerve conduction failure in Pmp22+/- mice. Our findings explain
  how abnormal myelin permeability is caused in HNPP, leading to impaired action
  potential propagation in the absence of demyelination. We call it "functional
  demyelination", a novel mechanism upstream to the actual stripping of myelin
  that is relevant to many demyelinating diseases. This observation also
  provides a potential therapeutic approach for HNPP.
