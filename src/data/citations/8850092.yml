  We report on a case of a female who had developed a fixed flexion contracture
  of the 4th and 5th fingers of the right hand which was painless and at-rest
  right in the beginning at the age of 19. By means of neurographical
  examinations a hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies was
  established in her and her mother, which had clinically manifested with
  symptoms of the ulnar nerve at the affected hand. The dystonic symptoms did
  not show any progression within ten years follow-up. A remarkable feature of
  the course was the twice repeated occurrence of short, sudden and complete
  remissions immediately following invasive diagnostic procedures. The thorough
  discussion of differential diagnostic aspects and the analysis of the familiar
  situation and psychodynamics of the patient resulted in the diagnosis of a
  psychogenic hand dystonia.
