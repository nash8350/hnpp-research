  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies case report and
  discussion.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an uncommon
  diagnosis that should be considered in patients with multiple compressive
  neuropathies. We present the case of a woman who presented with bilateral hand
  numbness and weakness. Electrodiagnostic testing revealed bilateral carpal
  tunnel syndrome, bilateral ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, left peroneal
  neuropathy at the fibular head, and a primarily demyelinating generalized
  sensorimotor neuropathy. Subsequent genetic testing identified a deletion at
  chromosome 17p11.2 to confirm the diagnosis of HNPP. Treatment of this largely
  self-limiting disease is controversial, and this patient suffered minimal
  disability with treatment including splinting and surgical releases.
