title: Surgical treatment of a tomaculous neuropathy.
abstract: >-
  Compressive neuropathy of the ulnar nerve at the elbow is the second most
  common nerve entrapment in the upper limb. Eight possible anatomical points of
  constriction have been identified. The most common constriction being the
  intermuscular septum proximally or between the two heads of the flexor carpi
  ulnaris in the cubital canal distally. Surgical release is successful in
  80-90% of cases. Certain rare genetic conditions can predispose susceptible
  peripheral nerves to similar compressive neuropathies but there is no
  literature on surgical treatment of such patients. We present a case of
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) often known as
  'tomaculous' neuropathy, in a patient with ulnar nerve symptoms who underwent
  a surgical release.
