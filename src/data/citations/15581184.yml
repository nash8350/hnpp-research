title: Peripheral nerve biopsy study in 19 cases with 17p11.2 deletion.
abstract: >-
  In most cases of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP)
  the diagnosis is now assessed by molecular detection of 17p11.2 deletion.
  However, the family history may be missing and the clinical presentation is
  not always informative. In such cases, a peripheral nerve biopsy showing the
  characteristic focal myelin sheath thickening ("tomaculae") may be helpful. We
  present a retrospective study of peripheral nerve biopsies performed in 19
  patients suffering from either a mononeuropathy or a generalized sensory-motor
  polyneuropathy, and for whom the finding of tomaculae led to a search for
  17p11.2 deletion, which was confirmed secondarily. Tomaculae and other
  coexisting neuropathological lesions such as uncompacted myelin, "onion bulb"
  formations, and axonal degeneration are described and discussed in the view of
  previously reported data. It appears that demyelinating lesions with tomaculae
  are strongly suggestive of HNPP but are not specific as they may be observed
  in other conditions. Moreover, these features may be overlooked if axonal
  degeneration is marked.
