  Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in a female with hereditary neuropathy
  with susceptibility to pressure palsy.
abstract: >-
  A 7-year-old female presented with fever, urinary incontinence, mental
  regression, gait disturbance, and lethargy after diarrhea. Magnetic resonance
  imaging revealed multifocal T(2)-weighted hypersignal lesions supportive of
  acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Her mother had been diagnosed with
  hereditary neuropathy with susceptibility to pressure palsy. The girl was also
  determined to have hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy,
  with a 1.5-Mb deletion in chromosome 17p11.2 encompassing the gene for
  peripheral myelin protein 22 detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization.
  Hereditary peripheral neuropathies may be a factor in triggering the
  autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system.
