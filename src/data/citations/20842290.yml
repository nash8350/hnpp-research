  The 5' regulatory sequence of the PMP22 in the patients with
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.
abstract: >-
  Little is known about the molecular background of clinical variability of
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) disease and hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). The CMT1A and HNPP disorders result from
  duplication and deletion of the PMP22 gene respectively. In a series of
  studies performed on affected animal transgenic models of CMT1A disease,
  expression of the PMP22 gene (gene dosage) was shown to correlete with
  severity of CMT course (gene dosage effect). In this study we hypothesized
  that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within the 5' regulatory
  sequence of PMP22 gene may be responsible for the CMT1A/HNPP clinical
  variability. We have sequenced the PMP22 5' upstream regulatory sequence in a
  group of 45 CMT1A/HNPP patients harboring the PMP22 duplication (37) /deletion
  (8). We have identified five SNPs in the regulatory sequence of the PMP22
  gene. Three of them i.e. -819C>T, -4785G>T, -4800C>T were detected both in the
  patients and in the control group. Thus, their pathogenic role in the
  regulation of the expression of the PMP22 gene seems not to be significant.
  Two SNPs i.e. -4210T>C and -4759T>A were found only in the CMT patients. Their
  role in the regulation of the PMP22 gene expression can not be excluded.
  Additionally we have detected the Thr118Met variant in exon 4 of the PMP22
  gene, which was previously reported by other authors, in one patient. We
  conclude that the 5' regulatory sequence of the PMP22 gene is conserved at the
  nucleotiode level, however rarely occurring SNPs variant in the PMP22
  regulatory sequence may be associated with the gene dosage effect.
