  Evaluation of nonisotopic labeling and detection techniques for nucleic acid
  hybridization.
abstract: >-
  We have used a double-stranded DNA probe linked to the cystic fibrosis locus
  to detect a single-copy gene from varying amounts of genomic DNA, with
  Southern blot analysis. The DNA plasmid probe was labeled with either biotin
  or digoxigenin. Biotin or digoxigenin was then linked to alkaline phosphatase
  (ALP) with use of streptavidin or anti-digoxigenin antibodies, respectively.
  ALP activity was then detected with a chromogenic (BCIP/NBT), chemiluminogenic
  (AMPPD), or fluorogenic (HNPP) substrate. Our results suggest that biotin and
  digoxigenin perform similarly and that the three substrates exhibit similar
  detectability under appropriate substrate incubation times 20-120 min (AMPPD),
  2-12 h (HNPP), and 18-48 h (BCIP/NBT). Under optimised conditions and the
  probe used, these methods detect single-copy genes from as little as 0.3
  micrograms of total genomic DNA.
