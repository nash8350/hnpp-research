  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant disorder with an increased susceptibility of peripheral
  nerves to mechanical lesions resulting in transient nerve palsies. Many
  carriers remain asymptomatic but can be traced by electrophysiological
  examination, thereby demonstrating that HNPP is a generalised polyneuropathy.
  By using highly polymorphic markers linkage analysis was performed in a large
  family with HNPP. This resulted in a maximum lod score of 4.20 at theta = 0.10
  with D17S520. Three-point linkage suggests that the gene for HNPP is located
  on chromosome 17 in the region between D17S250 (q11.2-q12) and D17S520 (p12),
  a region that has recently been shown to encompass a locus for another
  hereditary neuropathy, hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type 1 (HMSN
  type 1). This raises the possibility that HNPP and this form of HMSN type 1
  are allelic. In keeping with this speculation is our recent finding that
  D17S122, another marker from the HMSN type 1 region, displays apparent loss of
  heterozygosity in this family.
