  Hereditary liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant
  disorder of myelination resulting in susceptibility to pressure palsies from
  compression or stretching of peripheral nerves. This study examined axonal
  excitability at two sites (one distal and one proximal) in five patients with
  biopsy and genetically proven HNPP to understand the pathophysiology of the
  disease. Comparisons were made with age-matched control subjects as well as
  five Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A patients to contrast the findings and explain
  the different phenotypes of diseases affecting the same gene. Changes in
  axonal excitability were found in HNPP subjects, but these were not uniform
  along the nerve at the wrist there were prominent alterations in threshold
  electrotonus, whereas at the elbow there were only subtle alterations in the
  recovery cycle and the response to strong long-lasting hyperpolarisation.
  Threshold was raised at both sites, but the nerves were probably not
  hyperpolarised. Not unexpectedly, changes in CMT1A subjects were more marked
  than those in HNPP subjects and were uniform along the nerve. Structural
  abnormalities at the node of Ranvier are sufficient to explain the changes in
  axonal excitability in HNPP, and these abnormalities would predispose the
  nerves to conduction block when subjected to pressure or stretch.
