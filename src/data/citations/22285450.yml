  In this review we focus on Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathies and
  hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs). Although these diseases differ in
  whether they primarily affect the peripheral or central nervous system, both
  are genetically determined, progressive, long axonopathies that affect motor
  and sensory pathways. This commonality suggests that there might be
  similarities in the molecular pathology underlying these conditions, and here
  we compare the molecular genetics and cellular pathology of the two groups.
