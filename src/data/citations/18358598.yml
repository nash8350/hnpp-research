  A case of rare recessive oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) coexisting
  with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP).
abstract: >-
  Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is typically inherited in an
  autosomal dominant fashion and is characterized by late onset proximal muscle
  weakness, ptosis and difficulty swallowing. It is caused by expansion
  mutations in the PABPN1 gene on chromosome 14q11. There is also a rare
  recessive form of the disease caused by homozygosity of a very small expansion
  mutation in the same gene. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent
  peripheral monofocal neuropathies. In this report a patient with both
  recessive OPMD and HNPP is described. The presence of two genetically unlinked
  neurological diagnoses in the same individual is a rare event and may have
  delayed the diagnoses.
