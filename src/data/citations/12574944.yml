  This paper reviews the clinical diagnostic approach to hereditary neuropathies
  in adults by analysing elements that point to a neuropathy of inherited
  origin, different modalities of presentation, laboratory and instrumental
  diagnostic tests, including molecular tests, symptoms and signs of involvement
  of other organs. Different phenotypes may be identified according to disease
  course; involvement of motor, sensory, autonomic fibres; site of lesion
  (neuropathy versus neuronopathy); calibre of involved fibres (small-fibre
  versus large-fibre neuropathy); presence of distinctive symptoms (neuropathic
  pain); involvement of other organs or apparatus. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease,
  Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy, Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy,
  Fabry disease, Tangier disease, Porphyric Neuropathies, Refsum disease,
  Hereditary Neuropathy with liability to Pressure Palsies, Hereditary Neuralgic
  Amyotrophy, and other rare disorders involving the peripheral nervous system
  are reviewed.
