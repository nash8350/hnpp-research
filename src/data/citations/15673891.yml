title: Inherited neuropathy can cause postpartum foot drop.
abstract: >-
  Postpartum neurological complications occur in up to 1% of deliveries. Often
  prior anesthetic procedures are blamed, with medicolegal implications. We
  describe a young woman who presented with postpartum foot drop diagnosed as an
  iatrogenic L5 root lesion after uncomplicated epidural anesthesia. After
  neurological assessment some 5 mo later she tested positive for the common
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies mutation that was a
  likely contributing factor in the development of her postpartum neuropathy.
  Anesthesiologists should consider hereditary neuropathies in the differential
  diagnosis of postpartum or postsurgical neurological deficits if there is a
  suggestive clinical history.
