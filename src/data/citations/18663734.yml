  P0 is a transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily that plays a
  role in myelin structure and function. Myelin protein zero gene (MPZ)
  mutations usually cause a demyelinating variant of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
  type 1B (CMT1B), but there is a wide spectrum of phenotypic manifestation of
  these mutations. We describe three patients from one family and one separate
  patient who presented with a demyelinating neuropathy. Some had recurrent
  lesions at compression sites mimicking hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP). A heterozygous nonsense mutation (Tyr145Stop)
  corresponding to a T-to-A transition at nucleotide position 435 in exon 3 of
  the MPZ gene was identified in all patients. This mutation leads to an
  extracellular truncated protein, which may explain the mild phenotype.
  Therefore, such MPZ gene mutations should be searched for in cases of
  demyelinating neuropathy with acute nerve compression as well as in cases of
  the HNPP phenotype associated with normal the PMP22 gene.
