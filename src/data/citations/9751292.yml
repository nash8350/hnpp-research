  Six children, 4 girls and two boys, aged 5-14 years, with carpal tunnel
  syndrome (CTS) are reported. Median nerve entrapment had different aetiologies
  in each case. One patient developed unilateral CTS symptoms after intensive
  basketball training. He improved upon terminating this sporting activity. In 3
  patients bilateral CTS was associated with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, trigger
  finger and mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS IS = Scheie syndrome), respectively.
  The latter subject, a boy aged 11 years who had severe bilateral muscle thenar
  weakness and atrophy, made a good recovery after surgery. Two cases with
  bilateral CTS had autosomal dominant disease. One of them showed familial CTS
  with thickening of the transverse carpal ligament. The other child (5 years
  old) presented early bilateral CTS as first manifestation of hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). His relatives were
  asymptomatic, but they showed electrophysiological and nerve biopsy changes
  consistent with HNPP. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) are diagnostic in
  paediatric CTS. Moreover, NCS is an objective method to evaluate the evolution
  of the nerve lesions after surgery. NCS must be performed in nerves of the
  propositus other than the median, as well as in first degree symptomatic and
  asymptomatic relatives in order to identify possible familial neuropathies.
