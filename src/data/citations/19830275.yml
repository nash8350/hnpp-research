  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is manifested
  by a spectrum of phenotypes, from the classical HNPP course associated with
  intermittent nerve palsies to a neuropathy resembling Charcot-Marie-Tooth type
  1 (CMT1) disease. The majority of HNPP cases are associated with
  submicroscopical deletions in the 17p11.2-p12 region containing the PMP22
  gene, while PMP22 point mutations are rare, representing about 15% of HNPP
  cases. In this study, we present a patient manifesting with atypical HNPP
  phenotype associated with a new Thr99fsX110 mutation in the PMP22 gene. We
  conclude that all patients who fulfill the electrophysiological criteria of
  HNPP, even if they lack the typical HNPP phenotype, should be tested for point
  mutations in the PMP22 gene.
