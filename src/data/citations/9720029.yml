  An improved in situ hybridization technique, HNPP-FISH, using
  2-hydroxy-3-naphthoic acid 2'-phenylanilide phosphate (HNPP) and Fast Red TR
  was applied to analyse the community structure of planktonic bacteria in river
  water. Oligonucleotide probes specific for the domain Bacteria (EUB338) and
  five bacterial groups [Flavobacterium-Cytophaga; Burkholderia-Pseudomonas
  (rRNA III)-authentic Alcaligenes; Vibrio-Aeromonas; Pseudomonas (rRNA I) the
  genus Acinetobacter] were used to investigate the bacterial community
  structure at two sites differing in organic carbon pollution level. At the
  eutrophic site, 54-68% of all cells visualized by staining with DAPI
  (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) could be detected with probe EUB338. In
  samples from the oligotrophic site, 39-45% of the total cells hybridized with
  EUB338. At the eutrophic site, approximately 50% of the total cells were
  identified with the five group-specific probes; the bacterial community
  structure was dominated by the Flavobacterium-Cytophaga group and
  Burkholderia-Pseudomonas (rRNA III)-authentic Alcaligenes group. At the
  oligotrophic site, only 26-38% of the total cells were identified with the
  five group-specific probes. The community structure at the oligotrophic site
  was similar to that at the eutrophic site, although the percentage of
  EUB338-detectable cells differed. No appreciable change was found in the
  community structure during the sampling period at either site. The improved
  HNPP-FISH technique should be a useful tool for the analysis of microbial
  community composition.
