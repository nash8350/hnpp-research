  We describe three patients affected by a congenital motor and sensory
  neuropathy with excessive myelin outfoldings (MOs) [15]. Clinical and
  electrophysiological features supported the diagnosis of hereditary motor and
  sensory neuropathy. We previously reported a genetic study on these three
  patients, which failed to demonstrate either the duplication in chromosome
  17p11.2 or the mutations at exons 1 and 2 of the peripheral myelin protein
  gene (PMP-22) and suggested an autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance. In this
  study we described the absence of the most common mutations, which
  characterized other forms of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN).
  In particular the absence of molecular changes in the PMP-22 gene definitively
  sets HMSN with MOs apart from the more common CMT1A, hereditary neuropathy
  with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) and progressive sensory-motor
  polyneuropathy with tomaculous changes at sural nerve biopsy.
