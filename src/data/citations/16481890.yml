  An evidence-based approach was used to determine the frequency distribution of
  genes contributing to the Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease phenotype. We
  performed a combined analysis of 11 population-based studies from various
  ethnic backgrounds to generate an evidence-based testing scheme. To estimate
  the relative frequencies of the responsible genes for which population-based
  studies are not available, we used our cohort of clinically classified
  patients with CMT and related neuropathies collected before the availability
  of genetic testing. Similar mutation frequencies were detected in the various
  studies, revealing a uniform distribution of pathogenic mutations. In CMT1 70%
  of patients harbor the CMT1A duplication, followed by GJB1 mutations at 8.8%.
  MPZ and PMP22 mutations are less common, identified on average in 2.9% and
  1.5% of patients, respectively. Other genes not tested in population-based
  studies contribute to less than 1% of disease individually. In CMT2 MFN2
  mutations are the most common, although population-based studies are not yet
  available. CMT represents a heterogeneous group of disorders at the molecular
  level. Nevertheless, testing for the CMT1A duplication (i.e., duplication of
  PMP22) alone yields an accurate molecular diagnosis in approximately half of
  all patients. If one further specifies the clinical type (demyelinating vs.
  axonal), the yield of detecting a molecular defect increases to 75% to 80% in
  the demyelinating or CMT1 group with a screening test that evaluates for CMT1A
  duplication/hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies deletion
  and GJB1 point mutations.
