  Molecular Epidemiology of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease in Northern
  Ostrobothnia, Finland A Population-Based Study.
abstract: >-
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is the most common hereditary neuromuscular
  disorder with a population prevalence of 9.7-82.3/100,000. In this study, we
  have estimated the prevalence of CMT and its subtypes in Finland and examined
  the frequency of molecular etiologies. A population-based survey included
  adult patients with peripheral neuropathy from the province of Northern
  Ostrobothnia, Finland. Secondary causes of peripheral polyneuropathy were
  excluded and patients with clinical and neurophysiological features pertinent
  with CMT were included. Molecular diagnostics was carried out when DNA was
  available. We found 107 subjects with CMT yielding a prevalence 34.6/100,000
  in Northern Ostrobothnia. The heterozygous point mutation p.His123Arg in
  ganglioside induced differentiation associated protein 1 (GDAP1) was found in
  31.5% and peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) duplication in 16.9% of the
  affected. Point mutations in myelin protein zero, mitofusin 2, and gap
  junction protein beta 1 accounted for 6.7% of the cases. In addition, 18
  persons had hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies and 15 of
  them carried the PMP22 deletion. The prevalence of CMT in Northern
  Ostrobothnia, Finland, seems to be slightly higher than those in previous
  studies in European populations. Founder mutation in the GDAP1 gene accounts
  for a large part of the genetically defined CMT2 in Finland.
