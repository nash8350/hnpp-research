  The prevalence of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies in
  patients with multiple surgically treated entrapment neuropathies.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal-dominant peripheral neuropathy that results from deletion of a
  1.5-Megabase pair (Mb) segment of the short arm (p) of chromosome 17.
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies increases
  susceptibility of peripheral nerves to pressure and trauma and can be
  associated with symptoms at multiple anatomic entrapment sites. Many patients
  present with multiple upper-extremity entrapment neuropathies and the etiology
  is uncertain. We hypothesized that some of these patients have an underlying
  hereditary neuropathy. The purpose of this study was to determine the
  prevalence of HNPP in patients with multiple surgically treated
  upper-extremity entrapment neuropathies. The inclusion criterion for the study
  was history of more than 1 carpal tunnel release and/or ulnar nerve
  transposition. The exclusion criteria were history of diabetes or history of
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. Fifty-nine patients were in the study group.
  Two patients known to have the 17p11.2 deletion were used as controls. Genomic
  DNA was extracted from peripheral blood. Each sample was genotyped using
  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with short tandem repeat
  polymorphism markers within the 1.5-Mb region of 17p deleted in HNPP. Markers
  were scored as homozygous or heterozygous after resolution by polyacrylamide
  gel electrophoresis and silver staining. The 2 control patients were
  homozygous for 11 markers. None of the 59 study patients were homozygous for
  all markers tested in the deleted region. No study patient had the 17p
  deletion diagnostic for HNPP. Based on the sample size of 59 patients the 95%
  confidence interval for the prevalence of the 17p11.2 deletion in this
  population is 0% to 5%. We found no evidence for an association between HNPP
  and patients who have multiple surgical releases for upper-extremity
  entrapment neuropathies.
