title: >-
  From the syndrome of Charcot, Marie and Tooth to disorders of peripheral
  myelin proteins.
abstract: >-
  The description of the peroneal muscular atrophy syndrome in 1886 by Charcot,
  Marie and Tooth was followed by an era of nosological confusion. This was
  partly clarified by the advent of nerve conduction studies and the definition
  of the most common, but heterogeneous, disorders underlying this syndrome,
  hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies (HMSN) types I and II. The
  classification of HMSN is now changing as a result of the identification of
  underlying mutations in genes encoding myelin proteins. Abnormalities of
  peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP-22) account for dominantly inherited HMSN
  type I in approximately 90% of families. The commonest genetic defect is a
  duplication of this gene and the surrounding region of chromosome 17, although
  point mutations also occur. A deletion of the same region causes hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Point mutations of the P0 gene
  cause HMSN I in a small number of families. The X-linked type of HMSN is
  associated with defects of the connexin 32 gene, which encodes a gap junction
  protein. These molecular genetic advances can be translated into clinical
  practice, leading to improved diagnosis and genetic counselling.
