  [Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) in hand
  surgery reminds and warn against a usually unrecognised disease].
abstract: >-
  Tomacula is a rare hereditary disease due to a deletion on chromosome 17.
  Clinical presentation varies but patients usually complain of recurrent
  paraesthesiaes and palsies related to compression or trauma of a peripheral
  nerve. Diagnosis is based on electrophysiological studies, nerve biopsies and
  genetic tests. Implications for the patient and family members are a genetic
  counselling and some simple preventive measures. Although there is no curative
  treatment for this neuropathy, surgery can be useful for decompression of
  nerves and neurolysis. However, the surgical act increases the risk of nerve
  damage. Knowing about the diagnosis can help the patient and the surgical team
  avoid causing lesions.
