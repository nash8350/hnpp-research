  Two intercomplementary methods of 17p11.2 duplication/deletion identification
  have been elaborated STR allelic variants analysis and direct PMP22 gene
  dosage measuring by means of quantitative Real- Time PCR. It has been carried
  out detection and analysis of 17p11.2 chromosome region rearrangements in CMT1
  patients from Ukraine. It has been registered the high level of de novo cases
  with 17p11.2-duplication. It has been shown the 17p11.2 chromosome region
  duplication/deletion association with CMT1A and HNPP clinical phenotypes which
  may be used in differential diagnosis of this type of CMT polyneuropathy.
