  The role of carpal tunnel decompression surgery for patients that have
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is currently
  unknown. Since recovery from carpal tunnel compression is often associated
  with remyelination or nodal reconstruction rather than axonal regeneration, it
  is uncertain whether the PMP22 deletion associated with HNPP interrupts myelin
  or nodal reconstitution. We describe two patients with genetically confirmed
  HNPP and symptomatic carpal tunnel syndrome that had clinical and
  electrophysiological improvement after surgical decompression. The findings
  indicate a capacity for conduction repair in HNPP. They also suggest a need
  for further investigation and discussion around whether to offer carpal tunnel
  decompression to symptomatic HNPP patients.
