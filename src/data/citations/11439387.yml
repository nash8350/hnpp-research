  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal-dominant focal neuropathy characterized by recurrent entrapment
  neuropathies. Single members of families with HNPP and brachial plexus
  involvement have been reported previously. We describe a family with three
  affected members and in which the only symptom of entrapment was recurrent
  brachial plexopathy. The diagnosis of HNPP in this family was confirmed by
  both neurophysiological methods and DNA analysis. The distinction between HNPP
  and hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy is discussed.
