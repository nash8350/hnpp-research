abstract: >-
  Growth factors, such as ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), have been
  implicated in neuronal survival and proliferation. About 2% of the human
  population is homozygous for a polymorphism that induces truncated and
  biologically inactive CNTF but does not obviously change the phenotype. In a
  population of patients with hereditary neuropathy, a higher rate of the CNTF
  null mutation would indicate greater susceptibility for clinically significant
  disease, and a recent report attributes early onset and rapid deterioration in
  a case of familial ALS (FALS) to this mutation. We have, therefore, genotyped
  the CNTF polymorphism in a large group of patients with CMT 1a, HNPP, sporadic
  ALS, in one pedigree with FALS, and controls. All groups exhibited a similar
  distribution of the polymorphism. We conclude that absence of CNTF does not
  increase susceptibility for these disorders and confirm that it does not
  affect onset and course of familial and sporadic ALS.
