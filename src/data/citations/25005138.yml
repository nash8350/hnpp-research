  The aims of this study were to evaluate the sonographic findings of patients
  with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) and to
  examine the correlation between sonographic and electrophysiological findings.
  Nine patients whose electrophysiological findings indicated HNPP and whose
  diagnosis was confirmed by genetic analysis were enrolled in the study. The
  median, ulnar, peroneal, and tibial nerves were evaluated by ultrasonography.
  We ultrasonographically evaluated 18 median, ulnar, peroneal, and tibial
  nerves. Nerve enlargement was identified in the median, ulnar, and peroneal
  nerves at the typical sites of compression. None of the patients had nerve
  enlargement at a site of noncompression. None of the tibial nerves had
  increased cross-sectional area (CSA) values. There were no significant
  differences in median, ulnar, and peroneal nerve distal motor latencies (DMLs)
  between the patients with an increased CSA and those with a normal CSA. In
  most cases, there was no correlation between electrophysiological
  abnormalities and clinical or sonographic findings. Although multiple nerve
  enlargements at typical entrapment sites on sonographic evaluation can suggest
  HNPP, ultrasonography cannot be used as a diagnostic tool for HNPP.
  Ultrasonography may contribute to the differential diagnosis of HNPP and other
  demyelinating polyneuropathies or compression neuropathies; however, further
  studies are required.
