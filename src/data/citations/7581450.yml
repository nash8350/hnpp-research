  Hypermyelination and demyelinating peripheral neuropathy in Pmp22-deficient
  mice.
abstract: >-
  Peripheral myelin protein PMP22 has been suggested to have a role in
  peripheral nerve myelination and cell proliferation. Defects at the PMP22
  locus are associated with peripheral neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth
  disease type 1A. We now demonstrate that mice devoid of Pmp22 are retarded in
  the onset of myelination and develop abundant sausage-like hypermyelination
  structures (tomacula) at a young age followed by severe demyelination, axonal
  loss and functional impairment. Mice carrying one functional copy of Pmp22 are
  less affected but they also exhibit focal tomacula comparable to the
  morphological features in hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP). We conclude that Pmp22 is required for the correct development
  of peripheral nerves, the maintenance of axons and the determination of myelin
  thickness and stability.
