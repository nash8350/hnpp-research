  Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) is a group of genetically determined
  symmetric distal polyneuropathies. The CMT loci are known to map to chromosome
  1 (CMT1B), chromosome 17 (CMT1A), the X chromosome (CMTX), and two additional
  unknown autosomes (CMT1C and CMT2). The most prevalent form is CMT1A, an
  autosomal dominant demyelinative disorder caused either by a tandem
  duplication in band p11.2-12 of chromosome 17 (17p11.2-12) with trisomic
  expression of the peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP-22) gene or, less
  frequently, by a missense mutation of PMP-22. Missense mutations in PMP-22 are
  also responsible for two forms of demyelinative polyneuropathy in mice,
  trembler and trembler. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent
  focal neuropathy. In all families thus far studied, patients with HNPP have
  been found to be monosomic for a segment of chromosome 17p11.2-12. The
  duplication in CMT1A and deletion in HNPP map to the same region in 17p11.2-12
  and are both likely to be consequences of unequal crossing over during germ
  cell meiosis.
