  Conduction block in hereditary neuropathy with susceptibility to pressure
  palsies.
abstract: >-
  Slow nerve conduction velocities, temporal dispersion of action potentials and
  conduction block occur in polyneuropathies with segmental demyelination.
  Conduction block has been reported in focal compressive neuropathies and in
  acute and chronic autoimmune polyneuropathy but not in hereditary motor and
  sensory demyelinating neuropathy. We report conduction block in five nerves of
  four patients from two families with a hereditary neuropathy with
  susceptibility to pressure palsies and pathologic changes of segmental
  demyelination and tomaculous swellings. Conduction block that may be long
  lasting is a feature of this type of hereditary neuropathy, which should be
  considered in the differential diagnosis of this electrophysiologic finding.
