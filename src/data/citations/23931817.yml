title: Dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome and cognate disorders.
abstract: >-
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMT) is a group of genetically heterogeneous
  disorders sharing a similar phenotype, characterized by wasting and weakness
  mainly involving the distal muscles of lower and upper limbs, variably
  associated with distal sensory loss and skeletal deformities. This chapter
  deals with dominantly transmitted CMT and related disorders, namely hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) and hereditary neuralgic
  amyotrophy (HNA). During the last 20 years, several genes have been uncovered
  associated with CMT and our understanding of the underlying molecular
  mechanisms has greatly improved. Consequently, a precise genetic diagnosis is
  now possible in the majority of cases, thus allowing proper genetic
  counseling. Although, unfortunately, treatment is still unavailable for all
  types of CMT, several cellular and animal models have been developed and some
  compounds have proved effective in these models. The first trials with
  ascorbic acid in CMT type 1A have been completed and, although negative, are
  providing relevant information on disease course and on how to prepare for
  future trials.
