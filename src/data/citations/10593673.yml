  The clinical and neurophysiologic findings of two children presenting with
  focal weakness and atrophy in unusual nerve distributions and no apparent
  antecedent injuries are reported. Patient 1 presented with a droopy left
  shoulder that was initially attributed to scoliosis. Patient 2 presented with
  right biceps brachii atrophy that was first brought to his parent's attention
  during a routine physical examination. In addition to documenting focal spinal
  accessory and musculocutaneous mononeuropathies as the cause of weakness in
  Patients 1 and 2, respectively, nerve conduction studies also revealed
  evidence of superimposed diffuse demyelinating polyneuropathy in both
  children. The latter findings suggested the diagnosis of hereditary neuropathy
  with liability to pressure palsies and led to definitive DNA diagnoses.
