  Axonal dysfunction, dysmyelination, and conduction failure in hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.
abstract: >-
  Patients with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP)
  manifest with episodes of focal paresis when exposed to mechanical stress,
  although the basis for vulnerability to conduction block remains relatively
  unexplained. Axonal excitability techniques were utilized to provide insights
  into pathophysiological mechanisms in 13 HNPP patients, stimulating median
  motor and sensory axons at the wrist. In HNPP, distal latencies were
  prolonged, and motor and sensory amplitudes were reduced. Threshold was
  increased. Depolarizing and hyperpolarizing electrotonus was greater, and
  resting current-threshold slope was reduced. There were greater threshold
  changes in superexcitability, and refractoriness was decreased. Taken
  together, excitability testing in patients with HNPP established axonal
  hyperpolarization in both motor and sensory axons that may be attributable to
  changes in nerve architecture. In turn, the hyperpolarized resting membrane
  potential in HNPP may be a major predisposing factor for development of
  conduction block with mechanical stresses.
