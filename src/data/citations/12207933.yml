  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies with a small deletion
  interrupting the PMP22 gene.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is associated with a
  deficiency in the Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 (PMP22). Most hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies cases are caused by a deletion
  of a 1.5 Mb region on chromosome 17p11.2-12 encompassing the PMP22 gene. We
  describe a hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies family
  that lacks the common deletion, but carries a small deletion spanning the 3'
  region of the PMP22 gene, causing only a partial deletion of one copy of the
  gene.
