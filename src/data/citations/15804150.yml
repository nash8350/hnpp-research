  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), an autosomal
  dominant disorder, is characterized by recurrent isolated nerve palsies, which
  are precipitated by trivial compression or trauma. In this report, we present
  the clinical features, electrophysiological studies, nerve biopsy results, and
  molecular analyses of a Taiwanese family. Among the 7 members evaluated, one
  latent and three symptomatic patients were found who showed a heterogeneous
  presentation from asymptomatic to characteristically recurrent peripheral
  neuropathy. Electrophysiological studies revealed a general decrease in nerve
  conduction velocities in all four patients with focal conduction slowing,
  especially at the compression sites. A sural nerve biopsy with a teased fiber
  preparation in the index patient demonstrated a typical tomaculous appearance.
  Molecular genetic studies exhibited a deletion of the PMP22 gene in chromosome
  17p11.2-12 in all 4 patients. In conclusion, the diagnosis of HNPP might be
  overlooked if based on clinical presentation only. Family survey and
  electrophysiological and genetic tests should be done to investigate this
  disorder.
