  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy a recurrent and
  bilateral foot drop case report.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy is characterized by
  acute, painless, recurrent mononeuropathies secondary to minor trauma or
  compression. A 16-year-old boy had the first episode of right foot drop after
  minor motorcycle accident. Electromyography revealed conduction block and
  slowing velocity conduction of the right deep peroneal nerve at the fibular
  head. After motor rehabilitation, he fully recovered. Six months later he had
  the second episode of foot drop in the opposite site after prolonged squatting
  position. Electromyography revealed sensorimotor polyneuropathy of left
  peroneal, sural, posterior tibial, and deep peroneal nerves and also of ulnar,
  radial, and median nerves of both upper limbs. Histological examination
  revealed sensory nerve demyelination and focal thickenings of myelin fibers.
  The diagnosis of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy was
  confirmed by PMP22 deletion of chromosome 17p11.2. He started motor
  rehabilitation and avoidance of stressing factors with progressive recovery.
  After one-year followup, he was completely asymptomatic. Recurrent bilateral
  foot drop history, "sausage-like" swellings of myelin in histological
  examination, and the results of electromyography led the authors to consider
  the diagnosis despite negative family history. The authors highlight this rare
  disease in pediatric population and the importance of high index of clinical
  suspicion for its diagnosis.
