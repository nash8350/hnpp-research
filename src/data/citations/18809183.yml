abstract: >-
  A spontaneous demyelinating polyneuropathy in two young Miniature Schnauzer
  dogs was characterized clinically, electrophysiologically and
  histopathologically. Both dogs were related and a third dog, belonging to the
  same family, had similar clinical signs. On presentation, clinical signs were
  restricted to respiratory dysfunction. Electrophysiological tests showed a
  dramatic decrease in both motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities.
  Microscopic examination of peripheral nerve biopsies (light and electron
  microscopy, teased nerve fibers), showed that this neuropathy was
  characterized by segmental demyelination and focally folded myelin sheaths.
  Various clinical syndromes associated with tomacula or focal thickening of the
  myelin sheath of the peripheral nerves have been described in humans and shown
  to be caused by gene mutations affecting the myelin proteins, such as the
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies or the demyelinating
  forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. In animals, a tomaculous neuropathy has
  been reported in cattle and chickens but not in carnivores. Here we report a
  demyelinating peripheral neuropathy with tomacula in two Miniature Schnauzer
  dogs.
