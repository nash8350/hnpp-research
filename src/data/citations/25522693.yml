  PMP22-Related neuropathies and other clinical manifestations in Chinese han
  patients with charcot-marie-tooth disease type 1.
abstract: >-
  Most cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease are caused by mutations in the
  peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (PMP22), including heterozygous duplications
  (CMT1A), deletions (HNPP), and point mutations (CMT1E). Single-nucleotide
  polymorphism (SNP) arrays were used to study PMP22 mutations based on the
  results of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and
  polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods in
  77 Chinese Han families with CMT1. PMP22 sequencing was performed in
  MLPA-negative probands. Clinical characteristics were collected for all
  CMT1A/HNPP probands and their family members. Twenty-one of 77 CMT1 probands
  (27.3%) carried duplication/deletion (dup/del) copynumber variants. No point
  mutations were detected. SNP array and MLPA seem to have similar sensitivity.
  Fifty-seven patients from 19 CMT1A families had the classical CMT phenotype,
  except for 1 with concomitant CIDP. Two HNPP probands presented with acute
  ulnar nerve palsy or recurrent sural nerve palsy, respectively. The SNP array
  has wide coverage, high sensitivity, and high resolution and can be used as a
  screening tool to detect PMP22 dup/del as shown in this Chinese Han
  population.
