  Allele-specific all-or-none PCR product diagnostic strategy for
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1A and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies.
abstract: >-
  We designed allele-specific primers to amplify genomic DNA of patients with
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP). Genomic DNA analysis was performed on 40 unrelated
  CMT1A duplication patients, 25 unrelated HNPP deletion patients, and 50
  unaffected control individuals. The CMT1A and HNPP patients had previously
  been identified with microsatellite mapping. Amplification products came to
  3.6 kb in length from the normal proximal CMT1A repeated segment on chromosome
  17p11.2 (proximal CMT1A-REP), 3.57 kb from the normal distal CMT1A repeated
  segment on chromosome 17p11.2 (distal CMT1A-REP), 3.6 kb from HNPP patients,
  and 3.58 kb from CMT1A patients. We could identify the mutations by means of
  agarose gel electrophoresis after polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
  amplification without restriction enzyme digestion from 33 of the 40 CMT1A and
  19 of the 25 HNPP samples. Stringently specific primers were used to overcome
  the problem of nonspecific amplification and provide a rapid, all-or-none PCR
  product and efficient screening test for CMT1A and HNPP.
