title: PMP22 Thr118Met is not a clinically relevant CMT1 marker.
abstract: >-
  It is controversial if peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (PMP22) Thr118Met
  represents a functionally irrelevant polymorphism or, since hemizygosity for
  this variant has been found in two patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
  type 1 (CMT1 patients), it can act as a recessive CMT1 mutation. To shed
  further light on this variant and its diagnostic value we searched for
  carriers in 1018 individuals from the German general population, in 104
  probands with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP)
  who were carriers of the 1.5-Mb deletion frequently associated with this
  disorder, in 187 patients with the 1.5-Mb duplication, and in 22 patients with
  a CMT1 phenotype who did not have any detectable anomaly in the PMP22 gene.
  Using allele-specific PCR we identified 14 [allele frequency (AF)=0.007] in
  the German general population, one (AF=0.01) in the HNPP group and six
  (AF=0.016) and two (AF=0.05) carriers of the PMP22 Thr118Met mutation in the
  CMT1 groups with and without gene defect. Carriers from all groups showed
  nerve conduction velocities which did not differ from typical values for these
  groups. We conclude that the hemizygous occurrence of the 118Met allele does
  not usually cause CMT1. Because of previous reports on its association with
  disease, and because its allele product shows abnormalities in in vitro
  expression systems, it seems possible that this mutation, together with yet
  unidentified factors, predisposes to CMT1. Alternatively, previously reported
  disease associations occurred by chance, and the 118Met allele causes
  biochemical abnormalities irrelevant for CMT1 formation. In either case this
  mutation is not a clinically relevant disease marker.
