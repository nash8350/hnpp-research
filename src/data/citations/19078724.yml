  The spectrum of hereditary neuropathies has evolved recently as a result of
  the exponential growth of genetic research. For the purpose of this review, we
  will use Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT), hereditary liability to pressure palsy
  (HNPP) and hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN) to illustrate
  the current clinical and genetic approach to such neuropathies.
