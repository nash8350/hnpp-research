  New Vistas on the Pathomechanism of Charcot-Marie-Tooth and Related Peripheral
  Neuropathies.
abstract: >-
  A gene-dosage mechanism in CMT1A and HNPP has been postulated previously.
  Here, recent findings are discussed concerning (i) the functional consequences
  of altered PMP22 expression on Schwann cell growth regulation and on the
  capacity of genetically modified Schwann cells to myelinate peripheral axons,
  (ii) the cell physiological effects caused by the expression of certain
  disease-related missense mutations of PMP22 that are known to alter the
  Schwann cell phenotype and impair myelination in vivo, and (iii) the
  pathomechanism of CMT1 in light of findings on a novel association between
  PMP22 and Pin PNS myelin.
