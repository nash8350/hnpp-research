  Beneficial use of steroids in hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsy.
abstract: >-
  Management of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is
  primarily conservative, aimed at preventing nerve injury by avoiding trauma or
  other potential aggravating factors. No pharmacological treatment is known to
  be beneficial. We describe two adolescents, one with HNPP (male; aged 15y) and
  another with a clinical picture suggestive of HNPP (genetically unconfirmed;
  female; aged 14y), who showed considerable improvement of their symptoms after
  receiving corticosteroid therapy. Both individuals were symptomatic for at
  least 5 months before the treatment. Following corticosteroids, both
  individuals demonstrated rapid improvement leading to near-complete recovery
  of muscle power. Clinical improvement after corticosteroid therapy has been
  reported in some individuals with other hereditary neuropathies. Our cases
  demonstrate that corticosteroid therapy may also be beneficial in individuals
  with HNPP who have a protracted or incomplete course of recovery.
