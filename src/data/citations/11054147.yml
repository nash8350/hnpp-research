  We report the case of a 30-year-old woman affected by hereditary neuropathy
  with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), who developed a painless left
  axillary neuropathy after sleeping on her left side, on a firm orthopaedic
  mattress, in her eighth month of pregnancy. Electromyography (EMG) showing
  neurogenic signs in the left anterior and middle deltoid, and normal findings
  in the left teres minor, posterior deltoid and other proximal upper limb
  muscles, demonstrated that the lesion was at the level of the axillary
  anterior branch. A direct compression of this branch against the surgical neck
  of the humerus seems the most likely pathogenic mechanism. This is the first
  documented description of an axillary neuropathy in HNPP. Knowledge of its
  possible occurrence may be important for prevention purposes.
