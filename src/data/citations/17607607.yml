title: Early-onset hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy.
abstract: >-
  The clinical onset of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy
  (HNPP) in childhood is rarely reported. On the basis of a 5-year-old affected
  patient, we reviewed the cases reported in the literature to evaluate the
  clinical and genetic characteristics of patients with an early onset (<10
  years) of HNPP.
