  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) in a toddler
  presenting with toe-walking, pain and stiffness.
abstract: >-
  The typical clinical presentation of hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies is an adult-onset recurrent, painless monoparesis.
  Electrophysiological abnormalities--decreased nerve conduction velocities and
  delayed distal latencies--can be detected even in asymptomatic patients. We
  describe a toddler, who presented with asymmetric toe walking, painful cramps
  and stiffness in the legs. He had calf hypertrophy, brisk tendon reflexes and
  bilateral Babinski signs and the electrophysiological examination was normal.
  The unlikely diagnosis of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies was reached 5 years later, when the boy started to complain of
  episodic numbness and weakness in the upper extremities. His father, paternal
  aunt and grandmother had similar symptoms, but they had never been
  investigated. The typical 1.5 Mb deletion on chromosome 17p11.2-12 was found
  in our patient and his affected relatives.
