  The peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22) gene is associated with the most
  common types of inherited neuropathies, including hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) caused by PMP22 deficiency. However, the
  function of PMP22 has yet to be defined. Our previous study has shown that
  PMP22 deficiency causes an impaired propagation of nerve action potentials in
  the absence of demyelination. In the present study, we tested an alternative
  mechanism relating to myelin permeability. Utilizing Pmp22(+) (/) (-) mice as
  a model of HNPP, we evaluated myelin junctions and their permeability using
  morphological, electrophysiological, and biochemical approaches. We show
  disruption of multiple types of cell junction complexes in peripheral nerve,
  resulting in increased permeability of myelin and impaired action potential
  propagation. We further demonstrate that PMP22 interacts with immunoglobulin
  domain-containing proteins known to regulate tight/adherens junctions and/or
  transmembrane adhesions, including junctional adhesion molecule-C (JAM-C) and
  myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Deletion of Jam-c or Mag in mice
  recapitulates pathology in HNPP. Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which
  PMP22 deficiency affects nerve conduction not through removal of myelin, but
  through disruption of myelin junctions.
