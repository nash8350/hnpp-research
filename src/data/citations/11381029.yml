  The 1.4-Mb CMT1A duplication/HNPP deletion genomic region reveals unique
  genome architectural features and provides insights into the recent evolution
  of new genes.
abstract: >-
  Duplication and deletion of the 1.4-Mb region in 17p12 that is delimited by
  two 24-kb low copy number repeats (CMT1A-REPs) represent frequent genomic
  rearrangements resulting in two common inherited peripheral neuropathies,
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsy (HNPP). CMT1A and HNPP exemplify a paradigm for
  genomic disorders wherein unique genome architectural features result in
  susceptibility to DNA rearrangements that cause disease. A gene within the
  1.4-Mb region, PMP22, is responsible for these disorders through a gene-dosage
  effect in the heterozygous duplication or deletion. However, the genomic
  structure of the 1.4-Mb region, including other genes contained within the
  rearranged genomic segment, remains essentially uncharacterized. To delineate
  genomic structural features, investigate higher-order genomic architecture,
  and identify genes in this region, we constructed PAC and BAC contigs and
  determined the complete nucleotide sequence. This CMT1A/HNPP genomic segment
  contains 1,421,129 bp of DNA. A low copy number repeat (LCR) was identified,
  with one copy inside and two copies outside of the 1.4-Mb region. Comparison
  between physical and genetic maps revealed a striking difference in
  recombination rates between the sexes with a lower recombination frequency in
  males (0.67 cM/Mb) versus females (5.5 cM/Mb). Hypothetically, this low
  recombination frequency in males may enable a chromosomal misalignment at
  proximal and distal CMT1A-REPs and promote unequal crossing over, which occurs
  10 times more frequently in male meiosis. In addition to three previously
  described genes, five new genes (TEKT3, HS3ST3B1, NPD008/CGI-148, CDRT1, and
  CDRT15) and 13 predicted genes were identified. Most of these predicted genes
  are expressed only in embryonic stages. Analyses of the genomic region
  adjacent to proximal CMT1A-REP indicated an evolutionary mechanism for the
  formation of proximal CMT1A-REP and the creation of novel genes by DNA
  rearrangement during primate speciation.
