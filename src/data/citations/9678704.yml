  Mutation analysis of the nerve specific promoter of the peripheral myelin
  protein 22 gene in CMT1 disease and HNPP.
abstract: >-
  We analysed the nerve specific promoter of the peripheral myelin protein 22
  gene (PMP22) in a set of 15 unrelated patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1
  disease (CMT1) and 16 unrelated patients with hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). In these patients no
  duplication/deletion nor a mutation in the coding region of the CMT1/ HNPP
  genes was detected. In one autosomal dominant CMT1 patient, we identified a
  base change in the non-coding exon 1A of PMP22 which, however, did not
  cosegregate with the disease in the family. This study indicates that
  mutations in the nerve specific PMP22 promoter and 5' untranslated exon will
  not be a common genetic cause of CMT1A and HNPP.
