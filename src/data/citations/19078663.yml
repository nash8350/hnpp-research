title: Phenotypic Variability Leads to Under-recognition of HNPP.
abstract: >-
  To determine the range of phenotypic expression in individuals with hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) with the chromosome 17
  deletion. Twenty-one patients from 10 families were studied. Genetic testing
  was performed in at least one member of each family. Every patient was
  examined clinically, electrophysiological data was available in 18 patients,
  and a sural nerve biopsy was performed on 4 patients. In addition, a patient
  symptom questionnaire was administered over the telephone to identify
  symptomatic individuals from the at-risk population. The identified phenotypes
  were those of compressive neuropathy, symmetric peripheral neuropathy (often
  misdiagnosed as Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy), acute brachial paralysis, and
  confluent mononeuropathy multiplex. Many individuals were oligosymptomatic and
  these formed the majority of undiagnosed patients. The presence of mild
  symptoms and the marked phenotypic variability of the disease result in
  underdiagnosis of HNPP.
