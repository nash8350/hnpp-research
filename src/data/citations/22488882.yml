  'Tomacula' and myelin outfoldings are striking neuropathological features of a
  diverse group of inherited demyelinating neuropathies. Whereas the underlying
  genetic defects are well known, the molecular mechanisms of tomacula formation
  have remained obscure. We hypothesized that they are caused by uncontrolled,
  excessive myelin membrane growth, a process, which is regulated in normal
  development by neuregulin-1/ErbB2, PI3 Kinase signalling and ERK/MAPK
  signalling. Here, we demonstrate by targeted disruption of Pten in Schwann
  cells that hyperactivation of the endogenous PI3 Kinase pathway causes focal
  hypermyelination, myelin outfoldings and tomacula, even when induced in adult
  animals by tamoxifen, and is associated with progressive peripheral
  neuropathy. Activated AKT kinase is associated with PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) at
  paranodal loops and Schmidt-Lanterman incisures. This striking myelin
  pathology, with features of human CMT type 4B1 and HNPP, is dependent on
  AKT/mTOR signalling, as evidenced by a significant amelioration of the
  pathology in mice treated with rapamycin. We suggest that regions of
  non-compact myelin are under lifelong protection by PTEN against abnormal
  membrane outgrowth, and that dysregulated phosphoinositide levels play a
  critical role in the pathology of tomaculous neuropathies.
