  A Case of Apoplexy Attack-Like Neuropathy due to Hereditary Neuropathy with
  Liability to Pressure Palsies in a Patient Diagnosed with Chronic Cerebral
  Infarction.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is an inherited
  disease associated with the loss of a copy of the PMP22 gene. The condition
  leads to mononeuropathy due to compression and easy strangulation during daily
  life activities, resulting in sudden muscle weakness and sensory disturbance,
  and displaying symptoms similar to cerebrovascular diseases. We report the
  case of an 80-year-old man with left paralysis due to chronic cerebral
  infarction. His medical history indicated remarkable recovery from about 4
  months after the onset of left hemiplegia with predominant involvement of the
  fingers. Despite subsequent recurrent monoplegia of the upper or lower limbs,
  brain magnetic resonance imaging consistently revealed only previous cerebral
  infarction in the right corona radiata without new lesions. Medical
  examination showed reduced deep tendon reflexes in his extremities on both the
  healthy and hemiplegic sides. Nerve conduction studies showed delayed
  conduction at the bilateral carpal and cubital tunnels and near the right
  caput fibulae. Genetic analysis revealed loss of a copy of the PMP22 gene.
  Thus, he was diagnosed with a cerebral infarction complicated by hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Stroke patients develop sudden
  muscle weakness and sensory disturbance. However, if such patients have no
  hyperactive deep tendon reflexes and show atypical recovery of paralysis that
  does not correspond to findings of imaging modalities, nerve conduction
  studies and genetic analysis may be necessary, considering the complication of
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.
