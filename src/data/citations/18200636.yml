  Identification of deletion and duplication genotypes of the PMP22 gene using
  PCR-RFLP, competitive multiplex PCR, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe
  amplification a comparison.
abstract: >-
  We evaluated the efficacy of PCR-RFLP, competitive multiplex PCR, and a
  commercially available system of multiplex ligation-dependent probe
  amplification (MLPA) for the determination of deletion and duplication
  genotypes of the PMP22 gene. We compared the methods for efficiency,
  sensitivity, and specificity. We determined the gene dosage of the PMP22 gene
  via PCR-RFLP, competitive multiplex PCR, and MLPA. To demonstrate the
  sensitivity and accuracy of these three methods, a total of 185 samples from
  42 patients with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  (HNPP), 57 patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), and 86
  unaffected individuals, were analyzed. Molecular diagnosis by PCR-RFLP was
  performed on all 185 samples; 24 HNPP deletions and 33 CMT1A duplications were
  identified. In contrast, 25 HNPP deletions and 38 CMT1A duplications were
  identified correctly using competitive multiplex PCR and MLPA. Six samples
  were incorrectly identified by PCR-RFLP (one HNPP deletion and five CMT1A
  duplications). Competitive multiplex PCR and MLPA demonstrated reliability and
  relative speed compared to PCR-RFLP; they were superior to PCR-RFLP for gene
  dosage quantification. Multiplex PCR and MLPA should be the methods of choice
  for detection of deletion and duplication genotypes in molecular genetic
  diagnoses.
