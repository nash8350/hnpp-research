  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is a recurrent
  disorder of the peripheral nervous system characterized by reversible episodes
  of sensorimotor deficits after neural compression injuries. Also known as
  tomaculous neuropathy, HNPP is further characterized ultrastructurally by
  multiple focal thickenings (tomacula) of peripheral myelin and has an
  autosomal dominant inheritance. The neuropathology of HNPP includes a partial
  deletion encoding the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP-22) gene on chromosome
  17, resulting in underexpression of PMP-22. We describe multiple compression
  mononeuropathies in an individual with HNPP and report neuropathologic
  findings in 2 clinically asymptomatic family members. Diagnosis was confirmed
  using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. We believe that this diagnosis is
  clinically underappreciated by hand surgeons and should be considered in the
  differential diagnosis of patients with atypical presentations of compression
  neuropathies.
