  Brachial plexus lesions as a consequence of carrying a heavy backpack have
  been reported, but the typical clinical course and long-term consequences are
  not clear. Here we evaluated the clinical course and pattern of recovery of
  backpack palsy (BPP) in a large series of patients. Thirty-eight consecutive
  patients with idiopathic BPP were identified from our population of 193,450
  Finnish conscripts by means of computerised register. A physiotherapist
  provided instructions for proper hand use and rehabilitative exercises at
  disease onset. The patients were followed up for 2 to 8 years from the
  diagnosis. We also searched for genetic markers of hereditary neuropathy with
  pressure palsies. Mann-Whitney U-test was used to analyze continuous data. The
  Fischer's exact test was used to assess two-way tables. Eighty percent of the
  patients recovered totally within 9 months after the onset of weakness.
  Prolonged symptoms occurred in 15% of the patients, but daily activities were
  not affected. The weight of the carried load at the symptom onset
  significantly affected the severity of the muscle strength loss in the
  physiotherapeutic testing at the follow-up. The initial electromyography did
  not predict recovery. Genetic testing did not reveal de novo hereditary
  neuropathy with pressure palsies. The prognosis of BPP is favorable in the
  vast majority of cases. Electromyography is useful for diagnosis. To prevent
  brachial plexus lesions, backpack loads greater than 40 kg should be avoided.
