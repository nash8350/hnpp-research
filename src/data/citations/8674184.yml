  Molecular diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1A disease and hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies by quantifying CMT1A-REP
  sequences consequences of recombinations at variant sites on chromosomes
  17p11.2-12.
abstract: >-
  The most frequent form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT1A; OMIM118.220) is
  the result of a duplication on chromosome 17 in pll.2-p12. This region
  contains PMP22, a gene expressed in peripheral myelin. The mutation results
  from an unequal crossing-over involving repeated sequences, CMT1A-REP, located
  on both sides of the duplicated region. The reciprocal product of this
  recombination is a deletion of the same region, which is associated with
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP; OMIM162.500).
  Proximal and distal CMT1A-REP sequences can be distinguished by the presence
  of a variant EcoRI site. We quantified the number of these repeat sequences in
  36 CMT1A and 40 HNPP patients. CMT1A-REP sequences are involved in almost all
  of the mutations. The majority of recombination breakpoints occur distally
  from the variant EcoRI site. However, a few have a breakpoint proximal to this
  site, which creates the risk of misinterpretation with respect to a
  duplicated/deleted status.
