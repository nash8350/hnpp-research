  Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy with liability
  to pressure palsies (HNPP) are both autosomal-dominant disorders linked to
  peripheral myelin anomalies. CMT1A is associated with a Peripheral Myelin
  Protein 22 (PMP22) duplication, whereas HNPP is due to a PMP22 deletion on
  chromosome 17. In spite of this crucial difference, we report three
  observations of patients with the 1.4 megabase CMT1A duplication and atypical
  presentation (electrophysiological, clinical or pathological) a 10 year-old
  girl with tomaculous lesions on nerve biopsy; a 26 year-old woman with
  recurrent paresthesiae and block conduction on the electrophysiological study;
  a 46 year-old woman with transient recurrent nerve palsies mimicking HNPP.
  These observations highlight the wide spectrum of CMT1A and the overlap
  between CMT1A and HNPP (both linked to the PMP22 gene), and finally illustrate
  the complexity of the genotype-phenotype correlations in Charcot-Marie-Tooth
  diseases.
