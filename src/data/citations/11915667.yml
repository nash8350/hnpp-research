  [Molecular genetic diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies].
abstract: >-
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is the most commonly inherited disorder of
  the peripheral nervous system; in Norway, the estimated prevalence is
  approximately one in 2,500. CMT has been classified into a demyelinating form
  (CMT1) and an axonal form (CMT2). Around 70-80% of CMT1 cases are caused by a
  dominantly inherited 1.5 Mb duplication at 17p11.2-12 (CMT1A), encompassing
  the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. In contrast, hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is caused by the
  reciprocal deletion of the same 1.5 Mb region. We recently developed a method
  by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detecting CMT1A
  duplication and HNPP deletion. Real-time quantitative PCR is very sensitive
  for identifying PMP22 gene copy number in CMT1A duplication and HNPP deletion.
  We discuss molecular genetic testing of CMT1A duplication and HNPP deletion.
  Real-time quantitative PCR should find broad application in clinical and
  research settings, not only in CMT1A duplication and HNPP deletion, but also
  in other diseases involving gene copy number or gene expression.
