  Point mutations in the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene have been
  identified to cause demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP). To investigate
  the mutation spectrum of PMP22 in Han-Chinese population residing in Taiwan,
  53 patients with molecularly unassigned demyelinating CMT and 52 patients with
  HNPP-like neuropathy of unknown genetic causes were screened for PMP22
  mutations by Sanger sequencing. Three point mutations were identified in four
  patients with demyelinating CMT, including c.256 C > T (p.Q86X) in two, and
  c.310delA (p.I104FfsX7) and c.319 + 1G > A in one each. One PMP22 missense
  mutation, c.124 T > C (p.C42R), was identified in a patient with HNPP-like
  neuropathy. The clinical presentations of these mutations vary from mild
  HNPP-like syndrome to severe infantile-onset demyelinating CMT. In vitro
  analyses revealed that both PMP22 p.Q86X and p.I104FfsX7 mutations result in
  truncated PMP22 proteins that are almost totally retained within cytosol,
  whereas the p.C42R mutation partially impairs cell membrane localization of
  PMP22 protein. In conclusion, PMP22 point mutations account for 7.5% and 1.9%
  of demyelinating CMT and HNPP patients with unknown genetic causes,
  respectively. This study delineates the clinical and molecular features of
  PMP22 point mutations in Taiwan, and emphasizes their roles in demyelinating
  CMT or HNPP-like neuropathy.
