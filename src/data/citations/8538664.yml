  Tomaculous neuropathy is the descriptive term for the "sausagelike" swellings
  of myelin characteristic of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP). A 1.5-Mb deletion in chromosome 17p11.2 is present in the
  majority but not all cases of HNPP. We reviewed the clinical and
  electrophysiological features of 18 patients with tomaculous neuropathy and
  compared these features between patients with and without the typical large
  deletion. Patients presented with a variety of pressure-induced nerve palsies
  and brachial plexopathies. Two patients presented with generalized symmetric
  sensorimotor polyneuropathies. Four patients were older than their respective
  probands but were as yet asymptomatic. Nerve conduction studies demonstrated
  prolonged distal latencies out of proportion to slowing of conduction
  velocities, suggesting a distally accentuated myelinopathy. DNA analysis
  revealed the 1.5-Mb deletion in all the familial cases and in 3 of the
  sporadic patients. The clinical and electrophysiological features were similar
  between patients with and without the 1.5-Mb deletion in chromosome 17p11.2.
