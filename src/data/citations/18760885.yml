  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is an autosomal
  dominant disorder characterized by recurrent mono-neuropathies secondary to
  minor trauma or compression. Whilst typical episodes of palsy generally become
  apparent during the second and the third decades, HNPP is rarely diagnosed in
  the first decade. We present the case of a 6-year-old patient to draw
  attention to the possibility of HNPP attacks in the first decade and the
  importance of detailed electrophysiological examination.
