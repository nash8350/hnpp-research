  Ammonia oxidation is a rate-limiting step in the biological removal of
  nitrogen from wastewater. Analysis of microbial communities possessing the
  amoA gene, which is a small subunit of the gene encoding ammonia
  monooxygenase, is important for controlling nitrogen removal. In this study,
  the amoA gene present in Nitrosomonas europaea cells in a pure culture and
  biofilms in a nitrifying reactor was amplified by in situ PCR. In this
  procedure, fixed cells were permeabilized with lysozyme and subjected to
  seminested PCR with a digoxigenin-labeled primer. Then, the amplicon was
  detected with an alkaline phosphatase-labeled antidigoxigenin antibody and
  HNPP (2-hydroxy-3-naphthoic acid-2'-phenylanilide phosphate), which was
  combined with Fast Red TR, and with an Alexa Fluor 488-labeled antidigoxigenin
  antibody. The amoA gene in the biofilms was detected with an unavoidable
  nonspecific signal when the former method was used for detection. On the other
  hand, the amoA gene in the biofilms was detected without a nonspecific signal,
  and the cells possessing the amoA gene were clearly observed near the surface
  of the biofilm when Alexa Fluor 488-labeled antidigoxigenin antibody was used
  for detection. Although functional gene expression was not detected in this
  study, detection of cells in a biofilm based on their function was
  demonstrated.
