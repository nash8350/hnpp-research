  Point mutations in PMP22 are relatively rare and the phenotype may vary from
  mild hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) to severe
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 (CMT1). We describe the phenotype of the
  Gly94fsX222 mutation in the PMP22 gene. Medical records of all patients were
  reviewed and 11 patients were re-examined. EMG was carried out in nine
  patients and nerve biopsy in one. Thirteen patients originating from seven
  families with a Gly94fsX222 mutation were included and consisted of 10 women
  and 3 men with a median age of 41 years (range 7-67). Five index patients were
  originally suspected of CMT1. Ten patients had abnormal motor skills during
  childhood. Nine patients had a history of pressure palsies. Involvement of the
  olfactory, trigeminal, facial, and pudendal nerves occurred in three patients.
  Twelve patients had pes cavus and one scoliosis. Distal anterior leg and
  distal arm weakness were found in 12 and 4 patients, respectively. Twelve
  patients had distal leg sensory abnormalities. Electrophysiological
  examination revealed a demyelinating sensorimotor neuropathy, both resembling
  CMT1 and HNPP. Sural nerve biopsy showed demyelinating neuropathy with
  presence of tomacula. More than three-fourths of the patients with Gly94fsX222
  mutation demonstrated a CMT1 phenotype combined with transient deficits.
  Clinicians should test for this mutation in those patients exhibiting a
  generalised neuropathy combined with compressive like episodes.
