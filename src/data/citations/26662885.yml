  Application of whole-exome sequencing for detecting copy number variants in
  CMT1A/HNPP.
abstract: >-
  Large insertions and deletions (indels), including copy number variations
  (CNVs), are commonly seen in many diseases. Standard approaches for indel
  detection rely on well-established methods such as qPCR or short tandem repeat
  (STR) markers. Recently, a number of tools for CNV detection based on
  next-generation sequencing (NGS) data have also been developed; however, use
  of these methods is limited. Here, we used whole-exome sequencing (WES) in
  patients previously diagnosed with CMT1A or HNPP using STR markers to evaluate
  the ability of WES to improve the clinical diagnosis. Patients were evaluated
  utilizing three CNV detection tools including CONIFER, ExomeCNV and CEQer, and
  array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). We identified a breakpoint
  region at 17p11.2-p12 in patients with CMT1A and HNPP. CNV detection levels
  were similar in both 6 Gb (mean read depth = 80×) and 17 Gb (mean read depth =
  190×) data. Taken together, these data suggest that 6 Gb WES data are
  sufficient to reveal the genetic causes of various diseases and can be used to
  estimate single mutations, indels, and CNVs simultaneously. Furthermore, our
  data strongly indicate that CNV detection by NGS is a rapid and cost-effective
  method for clinical diagnosis of genetically heterogeneous disorders such as
  CMT neuropathy.
