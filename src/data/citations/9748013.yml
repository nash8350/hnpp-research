  A novel PMP22 point mutation causing HNPP phenotype studies on nerve
  xenografts.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) in most cases
  is caused by a deletion in chromosome 17p11.2-12 or, rarely, mutations
  resulting in a functional loss of one copy of the peripheral myelin protein 22
  (PMP22) gene. Point mutations that lie deep within transmembrane (TM) domains
  causing major structural changes in PMP22 are associated with severe
  neuropathy. A 25-year-old asymptomatic woman with a normal neurologic
  examination volunteered as a control subject. Electrophysiologic studies
  showed multiple entrapment neuropathies, prompting a search for a genetic
  defect. In addition, sural nerve fascicles from the subject were grafted into
  the cut ends of the sciatic nerve of nude mice and studied at 2, 6, and 8
  weeks and compared with controls. Direct sequencing of the PMP22 gene revealed
  a G-->A transition at position 202 in axon 3 of the PMP22 gene. To determine
  if this was a causative mutation rather than a polymorphism, 102 DNA samples
  from controls were studied; none showed a similar base pair change. In the
  nerve xenografts, there was a marked delay at the onset of myelination and an
  impairment in the regenerative capacity of the nude mice axons engulfed by the
  mutant human Schwann cells. The axon tips were enlarged and demonstrated
  neurofilament density increase. Neurofilament density distribution histograms
  were bimodal in xenografts as well as in the subject's sural nerve. This study
  provides unequivocal evidence that a base pair change causing a Val30Met
  substitution at the junction of the first TM domain and the extracellular loop
  of PMP22 results in the HNPP phenotype.
