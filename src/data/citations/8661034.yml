  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) is associated with a 1. 5-Mb
  tandem duplication in chromosome 17p11.2-p12, and hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is associated with a 1.5-Mb deletion at
  this locus. Both diseases appear to result from an altered copy number of the
  peripheral myelin protein-22 gene, PMP22, which maps within the critical
  region. To identify additional genes and characterize chromosomal elements, a
  1.5-Mb cosmid contig of the CMT1A duplication/HNPP deletion critical region
  was assembled using a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC)-based isolation and
  binning strategy. Whole YAC probes were used for screening a high-density
  arrayed chromosome 17-specific cosmid library. Selected cosmids were spotted
  on dot blots and assigned to bins defined by YACs. This binning of cosmids
  facilitated the subsequent fingerprint analysis. The 1.5-Mb region was covered
  by 137 cosmids with a minimum overlap set of 52 cosmids assigned to 17 bins
  and 9 contigs.

      The 1.4-Mb CMT1A duplication/HNPP deletion genomic region reveals unique
      genome architectural features and provides insights into the recent
      evolution of new genes.
