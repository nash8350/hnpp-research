  characterization, and phosphate ester hydrolysis using a Cu(II)-metalated
  cross-linked polymeric catalyst.
abstract: >-
  A multi-pyrazolyl cyclotriphosphazene containing polymerizable group
  N(3)P(3)(3,5-Me(2)Pz)(5)(O-C(6)H(4)-p-C(6)H(4)-p-CH=CH(2)) (2) has been
  prepared from the corresponding chloro derivative
  N(3)P(3)Cl(5)(O-C(6)H(4)-p-C(6)H(4)-p-CH=CH(2)) (1). The X-ray structures of 1
  and 2 have been determined. Compound 2 undergoes ready metalation with CuCl(2)
  to afford N(3)P(3)(3,5-Me(2)Pz)(5)(O-C(6)H(4)-p-C(6)H(4)-p-CH=CH(2)).CuCl(2)
  (3). Model compound N(3)P(3)(3,5-Me(2)Pz)(5)(O-C(6)H(4)-p-CHO).CuCl(2) (6) has
  been prepared and characterized by spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. In
  this compound, the coordination around copper is distorted trigonal
  bipyramidal, and the cyclotriphosphazene coordinates in a non-gem N(3) mode.
  Compound 2 has been copolymerized with divinylbenzene to afford cross-linked
  multisite coordinating polymer CPPL which is readily metalated with CuCl(2) to
  afford copper-containing polymer CPPL-Cu. The coordination environment around
  copper in CPPL-Cu has been evaluated by obtaining its EPR, optical, and IR
  spectra and comparing them with those of model compounds 3 and 6. The utility
  of CPPL-Cu as a heterogeneous catalyst has been demonstrated in the phosphate
  ester hydrolysis involving three model phosphate esters p-nitrophenyl
  phosphate (pNPP), bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (bNPP), and
  2-(hydroxypropyl)-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (hNPP). In all of these reactions, a
  significant rate enhancement of ester hydrolysis is observed. Detailed kinetic
  analyses to evaluate Michaelis-Menten parameters have also been carried out
  along with experiments to elucidate the effect of pH, solvent, and temperature
  on the rate of hydrolysis. Recycling experiments on the hydrolysis of pNPP
  with CPPL-Cu shows that it can be recycled several times over without
  affecting the rates.
