  There have been few studies regarding physical training-induced peripheral
  nerve dysfunction in patients with hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP), with the exception of soldiers that trained
  intensively. Here, we report a 15-year-old boy without family history of HNPP
  who developed bilateral painless brachial plexopathy following short-term
  barbell and plank training during a school baseball club activity. Muscle
  training-induced painless brachial plexopathy could be an initial symptom and
  may be underdiagnosed in adolescents with sporadic HNPP.
