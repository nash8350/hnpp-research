  HNPP is an autosomal-dominant inherited disease clinically characterized by
  painless, episodic, recurrent peripheral palsy often preceded by minor trauma
  or toxic damage. It generally develops during adolescence and rarely is
  reported in childhood. We observed two children with this disease. In one of
  the cases, also the child's mother is suffering from HNPR Clinical and genetic
  characteristics of our three patients are summarized in this article.
