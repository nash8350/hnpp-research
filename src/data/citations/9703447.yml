  There is phenotypic heterogeneity in patients with hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies. In rare cases, recurrent brachial plexopathy is
  the only expression of the disease. We describe a patient with three episodes
  of plexus brachialis palsy and a de novo deletion of the peripheral myelin
  protein-22 gene. We conclude that DNA analysis is a key issue not only for the
  differentiation of peripheral neuropathies but also in the diagnosis of
  recurrent plexopathies.
