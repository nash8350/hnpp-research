  We investigated 51 patients with multifocal neuropathies for the deletion of
  chromosome 17p11.2 described in families with hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). The deletion was detected in 24
  patients, including 19 patients from 14 of 15 families in whom HNPP had been
  considered likely on clinical, neurophysiological, and/or pathological
  grounds. One patient with a deletion had rather unusual clinical features for
  HNPP, presenting with a progressive scapuloperoneal syndrome. Overall, 7 (37%)
  of the 19 index patients with the deletion had no affected relatives, and less
  than half had evidence of a generalized neuropathy on examination. Peripheral
  nerve lesions were related to pressure in only 15 (62%) of the patients with
  the deletion. Nerve conduction studies in 23 of 25 patients and relatives
  studied showed a fairly uniform pattern of moderate prolongation of distal
  sensory and motor latencies and slowing of conduction velocities, and variable
  reduction of sensory or evoked muscle action potential amplitudes. The
  patients investigated who did not have a deletion of 17p11.2 were
  heterogeneous and included those with recurrent and/or familial neuralgic
  amyotrophy, two or more peripheral nerve lesions at common sites of
  entrapment, or a patchy axonal neuropathy of unknown etiology. In 1 patient a
  diagnosis of HNPP remains most likely. DNA analysis for the deletion of
  17p11.2 is clearly useful in establishing the diagnosis of HNPP, which should
  be considered regardless of family history or clinical evidence of a
  generalized neuropathy, and in patients with multifocal neuropathies that do
  not conform to the classic clinical practice of HNPP.
