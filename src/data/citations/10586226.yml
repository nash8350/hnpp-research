title: Molecular mechanisms for CMT1A duplication and HNPP deletion.
abstract: >-
  As the best characterized human genomic disorders, CMT1A and HNPP illustrate
  several common mechanistic features of genomic rearrangements. These features
  include the following (1) Recombination occurs between homologous sequences
  flanking the duplicated/deleted genomic segment. (2) The evolution of the
  mammalian genome may result in an architecture consisting of region-specific
  low-copy repeats that predispose to rearrangement secondary to providing
  homologous regions as substrate for recombination. (3) Strand exchange occurs
  preferentially in a region of perfect sequence identity within the flanking
  repeat sequences. (4) Double-strand breaks likely initiate recombination
  between the flanking repeats. (5) The mechanism and rate of homologous
  recombination resulting in DNA rearrangement may differ for male and female
  gametogenesis. (6) Homologous recombination resulting in DNA rearrangement
  occurs with high frequency in the human genome. (7) Genomic disorders result
  from structural features of the human genome and not population specific
  alleles or founder effects; therefore, genomic disorders appear to occur with
  equal frequencies in different world populations.
