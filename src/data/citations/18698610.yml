  Dejerine-Sottas disease (DSD) is a particular phenotype of the
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease spectrum that is genetically heterogeneous.
  It represents a severe form of hypertrophic axonal and demyelinating
  neuropathy. Although it is predominantly inherited as an autosomal recessive
  condition, autosomal dominant inheritance has also been described. To date,
  the autosomal recessive forms of DSD are classified into several CMT type 4
  (CMT4) subclasses based on allelic heterogeneity. We present a 7-year-old boy
  with a severe form of CMT disease consistent with the autosomal recessive
  phenotype of DSD. He was found to be a compound heterozygote for mutations in
  the PMP22 gene resulting in homozygous deletion of exons 2 and 3. The
  maternally inherited allele was the typical 1.5 Mb deletion involving PMP22
  seen with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP). The
  paternally inherited allele was a deletion of exons 2 and 3. Both parents
  presented with a typical clinical picture of HNPP. To our knowledge, this is
  the first patient reported with large deletions involving both PMP22 alleles.
  Our patient has also developed severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),
  a clinical feature not previously reported with CMT or DSD. The correlation of
  the phenotype and the molecular defects observed in this patient may set a new
  subcategory in the classification of DSD.
