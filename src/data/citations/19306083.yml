  Anti-myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) neuropathy is a chronic disorder in
  which IgM antibodies react with Schwann cell glycoproteins, including MAG and
  peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22). Nerve conduction studies show features
  of axon loss and predominantly distal slowing consistent with demyelination.
  Because a genetic loss of PMP22 function yields hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), loss of PMP22 function due to anti- MAG
  antibodies may result in increased sensitivity to entrapment. We investigated
  this by performing standardized electrophysiological studies in 16 patients
  with anti-MAG neuropathy and 16 disease controls with genetically confirmed
  HNPP. Disproportionate slowing relative to adjacent segments occurred in
  similar proportions of patients with anti-MAG neuropathy and HNPP, and was of
  the same magnitude in each group. Affected were the elbow, carpal tunnel and
  the wrist-hand segments of the median and ulnar nerves. However, in anti-MAG
  neuropathy as compared to HNPP, absolute values of distal motor latencies and
  conduction velocities outside entrapment sites were slower and amplitudes were
  lower. In conclusion, increased sensitivity for entrapment may occur in
  anti-MAG neuropathy and contribute to part of the nerve damage.
