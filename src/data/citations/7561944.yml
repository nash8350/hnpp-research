  Progressive sensory-motor polyneuropathy with tomaculous changes is associated
  to 17p11.2 deletion.
abstract: >-
  We examined for the presence of 17p11.2 deletion, by Southern blotting and
  fluorescent in situ hybridization, 3 cases with progressive sensory-motor
  polyneuropathy and diffuse tomaculous changes at sural nerve biopsy. We
  demonstrated in all the cases the 17p11.2 deletion, previously reported in
  hereditary neuropathy with pressure palsy, an inherited disorder of the
  peripheral nervous system with similar pathologic changes but a different
  clinical phenotype. The molecular study of the 17p11.2 region should be
  considered as a non invasive method for differential diagnosis in selected
  cases of progressive polyneuropathy.
