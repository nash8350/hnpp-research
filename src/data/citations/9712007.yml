  In six families with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  (HNPP) the 17p11.2 deletion was absent, but single strand
  conformation-analysis and subsequent sequencing demonstrated a heterozygous
  G-insertion in a stretch of six Gs at nt 276281 of the PMP22 gene, resulting
  in a frame shift after Gly94. Haplotype comparison of the six families
  revealed common ancestry. We compared the phenotype of 23 patients from these
  six families with the phenotype of 63 patients of 17 families with the common
  deletion. The patients with the G-insertion showed the clinical,
  electrophysiological and morphological characteristics of common HNPP, but in
  addition they had significantly more neuropathic features, mimicking
  hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type I (HMSN I) or Charcot-Marie-Tooth
  disease type 1 (CMT1). To explain this distinct phenotype we suggest that, by
  translation of the mutated gene, a markedly changed polypeptide is formed
  without the normal cytoplasmic C-terminal of the native protein, resulting in
  a loss of function similar to that with the common deletion, but exerting an
  extra disturbance of Schwann cell functions, probably by hampering normal
  myelin formation or maintenance.
