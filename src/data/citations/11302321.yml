abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy is a rare autosomal
  dominant disorder characterized by multiple episodes of focal demyelinating
  neuropathies after minor trauma to peripheral nerves. It usually appears in
  early adulthood with recurrent attacks of pain, numbness, and muscular
  weakness along the distribution of the clinically affected nerve. Segmental
  demyelination and thickenings of the myelin sheath are the pathologic
  findings. Electrophysiologic studies show a nonuniform mild demyelinating
  neuropathy with prolonged distal latencies. Genetic tests are available to aid
  in diagnosis as molecular analysis has identified a deletion in the chromosome
  17p11.2 in the majority of these patients. There is a paucity of information
  in the orthopaedic literature regarding hereditary neuropathy with liability
  to pressure palsy. A case report is presented of a patient with this disorder
  to promote awareness and recognition that this entity should be considered in
  patients with multiple nerve palsies.
