  Alterations in gene copy number have been shown to cause disease in humans.
  Two of the most common inherited peripheral neuropathies, Charcot-Marie-Tooth
  1A (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  (HNPP), are two such diseases resulting from alteration in gene copy number of
  the dosage sensitive peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. Many
  complicated and laborious diagnostic tests exist for the diagnosis of these
  diseases. The aim of our study was to develop the first quantitative multiplex
  real-time PCR assay for the diagnosis of CMT1A and HNPP. A total of 160
  individuals who were known to have CMT1A, HNPP, or were normal from previous
  testing were assayed by our multiplex real-time PCR method. The results
  confirmed the previously determined gene copy number of all patient and
  control individuals tested. The range of ratio values between the disease and
  control groups were easily defined. The assay is accurate, simple, and cost
  effective and can detect a 50% change in gene copy number. This represents an
  ideal assay for any small diagnostic laboratory.
