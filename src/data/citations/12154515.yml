  [Analysis of mutations in the chromosome 17p11.2 region in patients with
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 disease and in patients with tomaculous
  neuropathy].
abstract: >-
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A disease (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are common inherited disorders of the
  peripheral nervous system associated with duplication and deletion,
  respectively, of the 17p11.2 segment including the gene of peripheral myelin
  protein 22. We studied 48 subjects belonging to 29 families with clinical and
  electrophysiological signs of definite CMT1, 20 patients with suspected CMT
  phenotype, and 17 patients and healthy members of their families with HNPP.
  Blood sampling and DNA isolation, PCR, restriction analysis, southern blotting
  were performed using standard procedures. Of 48 patients with diagnosis of
  definite CMT1 in 25 (52%) we found a 1.5 Mb tandem duplication in chromosome
  17p11.2. These duplications were not found in any of 20 sporadic cases with
  the clinical phenotype of CMT but without reliable electrophysiological data.
  Only 13 (44.8%) of 29 unrelated CMT1 patients from the first group had 17p11.2
  duplications. Three of 4 sporadic cases (75%) with definite CMT1 had 17p11.2
  duplications. Of 17 patients from 6 families with HNPP deletion of 17p11.2
  segment was found in 15 (88.2%), as well as in 5 (83.3%) of six unrelated
  cases. Detection of CMT1A/HNPP recombination hotspot is a simple and reliable
  DNA diagnostic method, which is useful only for the patients with clinically
  already verified CMT1, and HNPP for further genetic counselling of patients
  and members of their families.
