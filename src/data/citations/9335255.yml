  behave as a gain-of-function allele.

  The most common form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, CMT1A, is correlated with
  a 1.5 megabase duplication on chromosome 17p.11.2 containing the peripheral
  myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. Deletion of the same region is associated with
  a second inherited neural disorder, the hereditary neuropathy with liability
  to pressure palsies (HNPP). Moreover, several distinct point mutations within
  the PMP22 coding region are associated with CMT1A and Dejerine-Sottas Syndrome
  in humans and the Trembler (Tr) and Trembler-J phenotypes in mice.
  Heterozygous Tr mutants (Tr/+) display severe hypomyelination of peripheral
  nerve fibers while heterozygous pmp22 knockout mice (pmp22+/0) are
  characterized by focal hypermyelination. These findings suggest that the Tr
  mutation does not generate a pmp22 null allele but rather produces its
  deleterious effects by either a dominant-negative or gain-of-function
  mechanism. To address this question in detail, we have compared various
  combinations of pmp22 alleles including Tr/+, Tr/Tr, Tr/0, pmp22+/0, and
  pmp22(0/0) mice with respect to the resulting myelin abnormalities. The
  combined analysis of these mutants demonstrates that the Tr allele can act as
  a true gain-of-function mutation in both, the heterozygous state on a null
  background (Tr/0) as well as in homozygous Tr animals (Tr/Tr). Furthermore,
  increasing the relative Tr gene dosage correlates with more pronounced myelin
  deficiencies and decreased levels of MBP and P0 in 18-day-old mice.
