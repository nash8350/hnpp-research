  Hereditary recurrent neuropathies are uncommon. Disorders with a known
  molecular basis falling within this group include hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) due to the deletion of the PMP22 gene or
  to mutations in this same gene, and hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA)
  caused by mutations in the SEPT9 gene. We report a three-generation family
  presenting a hereditary recurrent neuropathy without pathological changes in
  either PMP22 or SEPT9 genes. We performed a genome-wide mapping, which yielded
  a locus of 12.4 Mb on chromosome 21q21. The constructed haplotype fully
  segregated with the disease and we found significant evidence of linkage.
  After mutational screening of genes located within this locus, encoding for
  proteins and microRNAs, as well as analysis of large deletions/insertions, we
  identified 71 benign polymorphisms. Our findings suggest a novel genetic locus
  for a recurrent hereditary neuropathy of which the molecular defect remains
  elusive. Our results further underscore the clinical and genetic heterogeneity
  of this group of neuropathies.
