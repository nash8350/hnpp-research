abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal-dominant disorder of peripheral myelin characterized by episodes of
  recurrent mononeuropathies usually involving nerves at common sites of
  entrapment and compression. Additional features include evidence of a diffuse
  demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy on nerve conduction studies, focal
  myelin thickening (tomacula) on sural nerve biopsy, and a 1.5 Mb deletion on
  17p11.2 encompassing the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene in most
  families. Two girls, aged 10 and 12 years, presented with peroneal nerve palsy
  and peroneal nerve palsy plus tibial nerve palsy, respectively. In none case,
  a clear causal factor was recognizable. Neurophysiological studies both cases
  showed diffuse sensory and motor nerve conduction velocity slowing and
  prolongation of distal motor latencies. In addition, features of focal
  entrapment neuropathy were obtained at proximal peroneal nerve level. Sural
  nerve biopsy large axons demyelination, redundant myelin and intraaxonal
  looping (case 1) and tomaculas (case 2). Molecular genetics 17p12-p11 deletion
  was demonstrated in both affected girls, the mother and two maternal uncles of
  case 1 and in the father, paternal grandfather and two paternal uncles of case
  2. NHPP should be suspected in cases of peripheral neuropathy without clearly
  recognizable cause. Electrophysiological and molecular studies permit both
  delineation of the condition and identification of otherwise clinically normal
  family members.
