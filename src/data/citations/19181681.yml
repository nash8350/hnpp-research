  We investigated the involvement of rare (<1%) copy number variants (CNVs) in
  471 cases of schizophrenia and 2792 controls that had been genotyped using the
  Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array. Large CNVs >1 Mb were 2.26 times more
  common in cases (P = 0.00027), with the effect coming mostly from deletions
  (odds ratio, OR = 4.53, P = 0.00013) although duplications were also more
  common (OR = 1.71, P = 0.04). Two large deletions were found in two cases
  each, but in no controls a deletion at 22q11.2 known to be a susceptibility
  factor for schizophrenia and a deletion on 17p12, at 14.0-15.4 Mb. The latter
  is known to cause hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.
  The same deletion was found in 6 of 4618 (0.13%) cases and 6 of 36 092
  (0.017%) controls in the re-analysed data of two recent large CNV studies of
  schizophrenia (OR = 7.82, P = 0.001), with the combined significance level for
  all three studies achieving P = 5 x 10(-5). One large duplication on 16p13.1,
  which has been previously implicated as a susceptibility factor for autism,
  was found in three cases and six controls (0.6% versus 0.2%, OR = 2.98, P =
  0.13). We also provide the first support for a recently reported association
  between deletions at 15q11.2 and schizophrenia (P = 0.026). This study
  confirms the involvement of rare CNVs in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and
  contributes to the growing list of specific CNVs that are implicated.
