  The hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autossomal dominant disorder manifesting recurrent mononeuropathies. Objective
  Evaluate its clinical and nerve conduction studies (NCS) characteristics,
  searching for diagnostic particularities. Method We reviewed the neurological
  manifestations of 39 and the NCS of 33 patients. Results Family history was
  absent in 16/39 (41%). The onset complaints were weakness in 24, pain in 6,
  sensory deficit in 5 and paresthesias in 4. Pain was seen in 3 other patients.
  The following neuropathy patterns were found multiple mononeuropathy (26),
  mononeuropathy (7), chronic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (4), chronic sensory
  polyneuropathy (1) and unilateral brachial plexopathy (1). NCS showed a
  sensorimotor neuropathy with focal conduction slowing in 31, two had
  mononeuropathy and another brachial plexopathy. Conclusion HNPP presentation
  is variable and may include pain. The most frequent pattern is of an
  asymmetrical sensory and motor neuropathy with focal slowing at specific
  topographies on NCS.
