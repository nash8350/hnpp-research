  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by recurrent sensory or
  motor dysfunction. In 85% of HNPP cases the genetic defect is a 1.4 Mb
  deletion on chromosome 17p11.2, encompassing the PMP22 gene. Point mutations
  in the PMP22 gene responsible for HNPP phenotypes are rare. We investigated a
  17-years-old girl who led to our detecting a novel mutation in PMP22 gene. The
  mutation was also detected in her father and corresponded to a deletion of one
  tymidine at position 11 in exon2 (c.11delT). This novel mutation creates a
  shift on the reading frame starting at codon 4 and leads to the introduction
  of a premature stop at codon 6.
