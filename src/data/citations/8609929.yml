abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is usually
  caused by a 1.5-Mb deletion in chromosome 17p11.2, the inverse mutation to the
  duplication seen in the majority of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT 1A)
  patients. Although most patients with HNPP present with pressure palsies
  secondary to mild trauma, the clinical heterogeneity of the neuropathy has
  become more apparent following the discovery of the mutation. There are
  reports of central conduction abnormalities in CMT 1, however, there have been
  no previous reports of central nervous system (CNS) demyelination in HNPP. We
  report a case of HNPP with the typical DNA mutation whose clinical features
  and MRI of the brain suggested concurrent CNS demyelination. Further studies
  of possible CNS involvement in HNPP are warranted.
