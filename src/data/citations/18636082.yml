  Pupil abnormalities in 131 cases of genetically defined inherited peripheral
  neuropathy.
abstract: >-
  To investigate and correlate the frequency and types of pupil abnormalities
  that are associated with hereditary peripheral neuropathy in a large cohort of
  patients prospectively examined. A prospective study between 1998 and 2007.
  Patients were enrolled and examined after being seen in the neurology clinic.
  Data were collected on demographics, family and medical history. Patients had
  eye and pupillography testing carried out as well as being neurologically and
  genetically investigated. A consecutive series of 131 cases of inherited
  peripheral neuropathy were seen and categorized into five groups familial
  amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT), hereditary
  neuropathywith liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), Refsum's disease, and
  hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy. A number of unreported mutations
  were identified in these patient groups. Pupil abnormalities were common in
  the Refsum's group, with frequent abnormally small pupils. The inherited
  neuropathies commonly associated with autonomic abnormalities were frequently
  found to have developed bilateral Horner's syndrome, which was particularly
  prevalent in our FAP series. Abnormalities were rare in HNPP and CMT type 1,
  but CMT type 2 showed frequent and varied pupil defects. The results describe
  the pupil abnormalities that were frequently associated with the particular
  group of inherited neuropathy patients, but we could not predict the genetic
  defect or the neuropathy severity. This is the first study of the pupil
  abnormalities found in the inherited neuropathies and provides an overview of
  the frequency and type of defects seen in a large number of cases. This series
  along with the detailed tables will act as an important diagnostic aid in
  assessing these patients.
