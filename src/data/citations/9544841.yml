  Peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22), a membrane glycoprotein, plays a
  significant role in the formation and/or maintenance of compact myelin in the
  peripheral nervous system. We studied two pedigrees with Dejerine-Sottas
  disease and identified two novel mutations in the PMP22 gene one a 2-bp
  deletional mutation at nucleotide positions 426 and 427 of exon 4 (this is
  predicted to alter the reading frame at leucine 80 and thus to lead to
  frame-shifted translation), and the other a guanine to thymine substitution at
  nucleotide position 636 leading to a cysteine substitution for glycine 150.
  Both mutations were located in the putative transmembrane domains reported in
  many cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy, Dejerine-Sottas disease, and
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. The results suggest
  an important role for the putative transmembrane domains of PMP22 in its
  function.
