  [Molecular genetic diagnosis and clinical features of hereditary neuropathy
  with liability to pressure palsies in Belarusian patients].
abstract: >-
  To analyze the molecular defect, a phenotype of hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP, OMIM 162500), in patients with PMP22 gene
  mutation caused by 1.5 Mb deletion at 17p11.2. and present the principles of
  diagnosis and genetic counselling. Patients were selected on the basis of the
  results of the clinical/genealogical analysis, neurological examination and
  ENMG study. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes. DNA
  diagnosis was performed in 5 families (the PMP22 deletion was found in 9
  patients). The authors described clinical and electrophysiological
  characteristics and presented a diagnostic protocol. Identification of the
  mutation makes it possible to confirm the clinical diagnosis, assess genetic
  risks for the outcome and perform a prenatal DNA diagnosis in HNPP families.
