  Detection of deletion within 17p11.2 in 7 French families with hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP).
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant peripheral neuropathy which is characterized by recurrent
  episodes of truncular palsies. We have analyzed the D17S122 locus in 7 French
  families, including 18 affected members, with microsatellite RM11GT and the
  RFLP probe VAW409R3a. Only one allele could be detected in all affected
  individuals with the highly polymorphic RM11GT marker. Allele segregation at
  D17S122 showed no contribution from the affected parent to the affected child,
  demonstrating that an interstitial deletion within the 17p11.2 region is
  associated with HNPP in the 7 families studied. This same region is
  duplicated, however, in another inherited neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1A
  disease. This would be the first example of two dominantly inherited diseases
  caused by a 'in mirror image' deletion/duplication mechanism where a gene
  dosage effect would be sufficient to produce two different phenotypes
  characterized by abnormal myelination of the peripheral nerves. The RM11GT
  microsatellite is an informative tool for the molecular diagnosis of HNPP.
