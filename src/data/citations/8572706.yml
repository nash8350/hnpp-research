abstract: >-
  An in situ hybridization technique with HNPP (2-hydroxy-3-naphthoic
  acid-2'-phenylanilide phosphate) and Fast Red TR was used to detect specific
  bacterial cells at the single-cell level. By this technique, the fluorescent
  signals of target bacterial cells were up to eight times more intense than
  those of standard fluorescence in situ hybridization with mono-fluorescein
  isothiocyanate-labeled oligonucleotide probes. This novel HNPP-Fast Red TR
  whole-cell hybridization technique is available for the identification of
  small or low-rRNA-content bacterial cells in the natural environment.
