  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) results from the
  deletion of the PMP22 gene in chromosome 17p11.2. Clinically, it presents with
  painless pressure palsies, typically in the 2nd and 3rd decades of life, being
  a rare entity in childhood. We present the case study of a six-year-old male
  child who presented with left hand drop that he kept for over four weeks.
  Electrophysiological studies suggested HNPP and genetic studies confirmed it.
  With this paper, we pretend to create awareness to this entity as a diagnosis
  to be considered in a child with painless monoparesis and to emphasize the
  importance of electrophysiological studies in the diagnosis.
