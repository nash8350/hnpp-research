  The fate of Schwann cells in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathies was
  addressed in this study of nerve biopsies from patients with proven PMP22
  duplications and deletions. In frozen sections, apoptotic nuclei were detected
  using the TUNEL method. In adjacent sections, anti-neurofilament 68kD antibody
  was used as an axonal marker, while the antibodies to NKH-1 and low-affinity
  nerve growth factor receptor P75NTR were used as Schwann cell markers. In
  addition, plastic sections were used to determine the densities of myelinated
  fibers and Schwann cell nuclei. In all biopsies from CMT1A, TUNEL-positive
  nuclei appeared in clusters. In adjacent sections, areas of TUNEL-positive
  nuclei matched with areas devoid of neurofilaments and NKH-1-positive Schwann
  cell silhouettes, suggesting that the apoptotic nuclei belonged to
  nonmyelinating Schwann cells. In addition, quantitative studies on
  plastic-embedded sections showed a significantly reduced number of total
  Schwann cells compared with controls, strongly favoring a loss of Schwann cell
  by apoptosis. In HNPP, the number of total Schwann cells was increased and a
  significant Schwann cell apoptosis was observed in only 2 patients.
  Examination of plastic sections and teased nerve preparations from these cases
  suggested that the Schwann cell apoptosis might be related to the regenerative
  state of the nerve resulting from the process of sprout pruning. No strict
  correlation between p75NTR expression and apoptosis was found. These studies
  indicate that factors regulating Schwann cell number in early postnatal
  development continue to be important for Schwann cell survival throughout
  life.
