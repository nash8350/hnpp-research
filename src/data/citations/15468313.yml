  X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease phenotypic expression of a novel mutation
  Ile127Ser in the GJB1 (connexin 32) gene.
abstract: >-
  We report a family with X-linked dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX1).
  Three affected family members are described, who underwent detailed clinical,
  electrophysiological, molecular genetic, and histopathological studies. A
  novel isoleucine at position 127 with serine (Ile127Ser) mutation in the gap
  junction protein beta 1 (GJB1) gene was detected. The electrophysiological
  findings were consistent with a primary demyelinating neuropathy with
  secondary axonal loss and support this model of disease progression. All
  patients having the CMT phenotype and intermediate conduction velocities who
  are negative for CMT1A duplication/hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP) deletion, and whose family shows a dominant trait
  without male-to-male transmission, should be screened for CMTX1.
