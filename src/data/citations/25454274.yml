  Distinctive patterns of sonographic nerve enlargement in Charcot-Marie-Tooth
  type 1A and hereditary neuropathy with pressure palsies.
abstract: >-
  The extent of sonomorphologic differences of peripheral nerves between CMT and
  HNPP is unknown. We recruited 9 patients with CMT-1A and 9 with HNPP. Patients
  underwent a standardized sonographic protocol, which evaluated nerve size and
  vascularization. We quantitatively assessed fascicle size and echogenicity.
  All 18 patients demonstrated nerve enlargement, but no increased
  vascularization. HNPP demonstrated larger nerves at sites of entrapment
  (median nerve at the carpal tunnel p=0.049, ulnar nerve at the sulcus
  p<0.001), greater swelling ratios of median (p<0.001), ulnar (p=0.017) and
  fibular nerve (p=0.005) than CMT-1A. CMT-1A revealed larger nerves proximal to
  sites of entrapment (median and fibular nerve, brachial plexus p<0.001). Nerve
  fascicles where larger (p<0.001) and more hypo-echogenic in CMT-1A. Nerve,
  fascicle size nor echogenicity correlated with age, gender or MRC sum-score.
  Ultrasonography of nerves reveals specific phenotypes differentiating CMT-1A
  from HNPP. In CMT-1A enlargement of nerves and fascicles is multifocal among
  multiple nerves, whereas in HNPP nerve enlargement is restricted to sites of
  entrapment. Our findings of specific sonomorphological phenotypes,
  differentiating CMT-1A from HNPP, may help to improve our pathophysiological
  insights in CMT and HNPP.
