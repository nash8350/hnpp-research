  The literature concerning hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies is reviewed. We describe 23 affected members of 7 families; one of
  them studied since 1966. The differential diagnosis with heredofamilial plexus
  brachialis neuropathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome is discussed. Our
  subjects are similar to those described in the literature; they have presented
  episodes of recurring painless palsies, most often related to minimal neural
  trauma. Neuromyographic examinations revealed chronic denervation, slowed
  conduction velocities particularly at entrapment sites and sometimes
  neurapraxia. We emphasise the conduction blocks for we believe their tendency
  to long duration (up to 8 years) and presence at several sites in a same
  patient are characteristic of this affection. Moreover we suggest that this
  neurapraxia is related to the existence of the tomacula. The possibilities of
  prevention and treatment are reviewed (two neurolyses performed in one patient
  presenting with long lasting conduction blocks at 2 entrapment sites have
  proved to be a successful treatment.
