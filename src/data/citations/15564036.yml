abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies arises as a result of
  defects at the chromosome 17p11.2-12 locus and in 84% of cases a 1.5 Mb
  deletion containing the PMP22 gene is detected by analysis that utilises
  polymorphic (CA)n repeat markers which flank this gene. We report the clinical
  and electrophysiological findings observed in a kindred with three members
  affected by HNPP due to a deletion containing exons 4 and 5 of the PMP22 gene.
  This small deletion cannot be detected using standard analysis with
  polymorphic (CA)n repeat markers and a definitive diagnosis was made by
  multiplex ligation-dependent probe analysis of PMP22 exons 1A-5. MLPA can be
  readily utilised as a routine diagnostic laboratory test to detect the common
  HNPP 1.5 Mb deletion, as well as the reciprocal 1.5 Mb insertion observed in
  CMT1A, but has the advantage over other diagnostic techniques of being able to
  define single exon deletions.
