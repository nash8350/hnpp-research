  Evaluation of distal symmetric polyneuropathy the role of laboratory and
  genetic testing (an evidence-based review).
abstract: >-
  Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) is the most common variety of
  neuropathy. Since the evaluation of this disorder is not standardized, the
  available literature was reviewed to provide evidence-based guidelines
  regarding the role of laboratory and genetic tests for the assessment of DSP.
  A literature review using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, and Current
  Contents was performed to identify the best evidence regarding the evaluation
  of polyneuropathy published between 1980 and March 2007. Articles were
  classified according to a four-tiered level of evidence scheme and
  recommendations were based on the level of evidence. (1) Screening laboratory
  tests may be considered for all patients with polyneuropathy (Level C). Those
  tests that provide the highest yield of abnormality are blood glucose, serum
  B(12) with metabolites (methylmalonic acid with or without homocysteine), and
  serum protein immunofixation electrophoresis (Level C). If there is no
  definite evidence of diabetes mellitus by routine testing of blood glucose,
  testing for impaired glucose tolerance may be considered in distal symmetric
  sensory polyneuropathy (Level C). (2) Genetic testing is established as useful
  for the accurate diagnosis and classification of hereditary neuropathies
  (Level A). Genetic testing may be considered in patients with cryptogenic
  polyneuropathy who exhibit a hereditary neuropathy phenotype (Level C).
  Initial genetic testing should be guided by the clinical phenotype,
  inheritance pattern, and electrodiagnostic (EDX) features and should focus on
  the most common abnormalities, which are CMT1A duplication/HNPP deletion, Cx32
  (GJB1), and MFN2 mutation screening. There is insufficient evidence to
  determine the usefulness of routine genetic testing in patients with
  cryptogenic polyneuropathy who do not exhibit a hereditary neuropathy
  phenotype (Level U).
