  Acute generalized neuropathy as the presenting manifestation of hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is rare. We report a
  19-year-old Army recruit who exercised regularly for 9 months and presented
  with 2 weeks of numbness, tingling, and weakness in both upper and lower
  extremities, starting 2 weeks after influenza vaccination and 1 day after
  vigorous exercise. Based on acute onset, clinical examination and
  electrophysiological findings, Guillain-Barre syndrome was diagnosed, and
  intravenous immunoglobulin was administered with minimal improvement. The
  presence of high foot arches and scapular winging raised suspicion of HNPP,
  confirmed by genetic testing. The role of the influenza vaccine in the
  development of symptoms is discussed. This case highlights the fact that HNPP
  can present as an acute generalized neuropathy even in people who train
  regularly. Careful history, physical examination, and evidence of entrapment
  neuropathies in nerve conduction study can aid in the diagnosis.
