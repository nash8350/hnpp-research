title: Transgenic Mouse Models of CMT1A and HNPP.
abstract: >-
  We have generated several PMP22 animal mutants with altered PMP22 gene dosage.
  A moderate increase in the number of PMP22 genes led to hypomyelination
  comparable to CMT1A, whereas high copy numbers of transgenic PMP22 resulted in
  phenotypes resembling more severe forms of hereditary motor and sensory
  neuropathies. In contrast, eliminating one of the two normal PMP22 genes by
  gene targeting caused unstable focal hypermyelination (tomacula) similar to
  the pathology in HNPP. A related but more severe phenotype was observed in
  mice that lack PMP22 completely. Detailed analysis of the different PMP22
  mutants revealed, in addition to the obvious myelinopathy, distal axonopathy
  as a characteristic feature. We conclude that the maintenance of axons might
  be a promising target for therapeutic interventions in these demyelinating
  hereditary neuropathies. Furthermore, our results strongly support the concept
  that PMP22-related neuropathies (and most likely also other forms of inherited
  motor and sensory neuropathies) should be viewed as the consequence of
  impaired neuron-Schwann cell interactions that are likely already to be
  operative during development. Such considerations should be taken into account
  in the design of potential novel treatment strategies.
