  The gene encoding the peripheral myelin protein PMP22 is affected by various
  mutations in the hereditary peripheral neuropathies Charcot-Marie-Tooth
  disease type 1A (CMT1A), Déjérine-Sottas syndrome (DSS) and hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). In contrast to the
  recent remarkable progress in the genetics of the PMP22 gene, the biological
  function of PMP22 remains largely unknown. In this report, we have confirmed
  by using in situ hybridization techniques that high levels of PMP22 mRNA are
  present in maturing peripheral nerves of the 2-week-old mouse, a finding
  consistent with the PNS-specific defect observed in hereditary peripheral
  neuropathies. However, high levels of PMP22 transcripts were also found in the
  villi of the adult gut, and PMP22 expression was detected in various
  non-neural tissues during embryonic mouse development. In early embryogenesis
  (9.5 days postconception, dpc), PMP22 RNA expression appears restricted to the
  epithelial ectodermal layer. During early organogenesis (11.5 dpc),
  particularly high levels of expression are present in the capsule surrounding
  the liver and in the forming gut, while low levels of PMP22 mRNA can be found
  in precartilagous condensations forming the vertebrae and the ventricular
  layer of the myelencephalon. During midgestation development (14.5 dpc to 16.5
  dpc), the number of PMP22-positive tissues increases, and high expression is
  detected in several mesoderm-derived tissues, in particular connective tissues
  of the face region, bones including the vertebrae, the lung mesenchym, and in
  muscles. In addition, high expression is also found in ectoderm-derived
  tissues, especially the epithelia of the lens and the skin. These findings
  strongly suggest that PMP22 serves not only a PNS-specific function but is
  also of broader biological significance in cell proliferation and/or
  differentiation.
