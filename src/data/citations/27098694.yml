  The signaling pathways that regulate myelination in the PNS remain poorly
  understood. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase 1A, activated in
  Schwann cells by neuregulin and the extracellular matrix, has an essential
  role in the early events of myelination. Akt/PKB, a key effector of
  phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase 1A, was previously implicated
  in CNS, but not PNS myelination. Here we demonstrate that Akt plays a crucial
  role in axon ensheathment and in the regulation of myelin sheath thickness in
  the PNS. Pharmacological inhibition of Akt in DRG neuron-Schwann cell
  cocultures dramatically decreased MBP and P0 levels and myelin sheath
  formation without affecting expression of Krox20/Egr2, a key transcriptional
  regulator of myelination. Conversely, expression of an activated form of Akt
  in purified Schwann cells increased expression of myelin proteins, but not
  Krox20/Egr2, and the levels of activated Rac1. Transgenic mice expressing a
  membrane-targeted, activated form of Akt under control of the 2',3'-cyclic
  nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase promoter, exhibited thicker PNS and CNS myelin
  sheaths, and PNS myelin abnormalities, such as tomacula and myelin
  infoldings/outfoldings, centered around the paranodes and Schmidt Lanterman
  incisures. These effects were corrected by rapamycin treatmentin vivo
  Importantly, Akt activity in the transgenic mice did not induce myelination of
  nonmyelinating Schwann cells in the sympathetic trunk or Remak fibers of the
  dorsal roots, although, in those structures, they wrapped membranes
  redundantly around axons. Together, our data indicate that Akt is crucial for
  PNS myelination driving axonal wrapping by unmyelinated and myelinated Schwann
  cells and enhancing myelin protein synthesis in myelinating Schwann cells.
  Although the role of the key serine/threonine kinase Akt in promoting CNS
  myelination has been demonstrated, its role in the PNS has not been
  established and remains uncertain. This work reveals that Akt controls several
  key steps of the PNS myelination. First, its activity promotes membrane
  production and axonal wrapping independent of a transcriptional effect. In
  myelinated axons, it also enhances myelin thickness through the mTOR pathway.
  Finally, sustained Akt activation in Schwann cells leads to
  hypermyelination/dysmyelination, mimicking some features present in
  neuropathies, such as hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  or demyelinating forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Together, these data
  demonstrate the role of Akt in regulatory mechanisms underlying axonal
  wrapping and myelination in the PNS.
