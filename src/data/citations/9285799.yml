  The CMT1A-REPs are two large directly repeating DNA sequences located on
  chromosome 17p11.2-p12 flanking the region duplicated in patients with
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and deleted in patients with
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). We have
  sequenced two cosmids, c74F4 and c15H12, which contain the entire proximal and
  distal CMT1A-REPs and determined that these repeats are approximately 99%
  identical across a 24,011 bp region. In addition, both contain an exon of the
  human heme Afarnesyltransferase gene (COX10). Hybridization studies revealed
  that COX10 spans the distal CMT1A-REP, while the proximal CMT1A-REP contains
  an isolated COX10 'pseudo-exon'. There is also a COX10 hybridization signal on
  chromosome 10 which appears to represent a processed pseudogene. We propose
  that the distal CMT1A-REP represents the progenitor copy of COX10 exon VI
  which was duplicated with surrounding intronic sequences during mammalian
  genome evolution and that the HNPP deletion results in a COX10 null allele.
