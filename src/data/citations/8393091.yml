  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies a clinical,
  electroneurophysiological and morphological study.
abstract: >-
  Clinical, electroneurographic and myographic studies were performed on 99
  patients of 13 families having hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP) and on 116 relatives. Diagnosis was confirmed in all
  families by a nerve biopsy of the index case. Large focal myelin thickenings
  (tomacula) were found in nerve biopsies of affected persons, whether or not
  pressure palsies had occurred. By using three electroneurographical parameters
  it was possible to discriminate between asymptomatic patients and unaffected
  relatives. Complaints sometimes mentioned in literature as being associated
  with HNPP such as low back pain, brachialgia and short lasting paraesthesia
  are not related to HNPP. The hereditary transmission is autosomal dominant
  with total penetration but variable expression.
