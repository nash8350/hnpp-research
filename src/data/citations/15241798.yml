abstract: >-
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are the two most common peripheral
  neuropathies, with incidences of about 1 in 2,500. Several techniques can be
  used to detect the typical 1.5-Mb duplication or deletion associated with
  these respective conditions, but none combines simplicity with high
  sensitivity. MLPA is a new technique for measuring sequence dosage. We have
  assessed its performance for the detection of the specific 1.5-Mb
  duplication/deletion by prospectively testing 50 patients referred with
  differential diagnoses of CMT or HNPP. Probes were designed to evaluate the
  TEKT3, PMP22, and COX10 genes within the CMT1A/HNPP region. We have compared
  the results with our existing fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay,
  which was performed in parallel. There was concordance of results for 49
  patients. Of note, one patient showed an intermediate multiplex
  ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) result with an abnormal FISH
  result, which is consistent with mosaicism. The assay works equally well with
  either purified DNA or rapid DNA preparations made by direct cell lysis. The
  use of the latter significantly reduces the cost of the assay. MLPA is a
  sensitive, specific, robust, and cost-effective technique suitable for fast,
  high-throughput testing and offers distinct advantages over other testing
  methods.
