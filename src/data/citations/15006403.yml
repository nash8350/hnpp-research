  Pendant pyrazolylcyclophosphazene containing hybrid cross-linked polymer
  (CPPL) has been utilized for binding Zn(II). The metalated polymer (CPPL-Zn)
  has been found to be very effective catalyst for the hydrolysis of a RNA model
  phosphodiester substrate [2-(hydroxypropyl)-p-nitrophenyl phosphate, hNPP]. In
  addition, CPPL-Zn also cleaved supercoiled plasmid DNA pBR322 thus providing a
  novel structural motif of inorganic-organic hybrid polymers as synthetic
  nucleases.
