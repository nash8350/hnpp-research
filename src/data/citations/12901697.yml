title: Dominantly inherited peripheral neuropathies.
abstract: >-
  Since 1886, the year that Charcot and Marie and Tooth described a genetic
  "peroneal muscular atrophy syndrome," electrophysiological and histological
  studies of the peripheral nervous system have greatly aided the
  characterization of this syndrome, which falls among the hereditary
  sensory-motor neuropathies. Two principal forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT)
  disease have been distinguished CMT 1, corresponding to a demyelinating type,
  and CMT 2, corresponding to an axonal type. The modes of transmission of these
  types are variable, recessive or dominant, autosomal, or X-linked. Our
  discussion here is confined to the dominant forms. In recent years, advances
  in molecular biology have greatly modified the approach to CMT disease and
  related neuropathies (such as hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies). With increased knowledge of responsible gene mutations and several
  other loci identified by linkage studies, our understanding of the
  pathophysiology of these neuropathies is increasing; however, with greater
  understanding, the classification of these disorders is becoming more complex.
  In this review we present and discuss the currently characterized subtypes,
  with emphasis on their known histological aspects. While nerve biopsy has lost
  its diagnostic importance in certain forms of the disease, such as CMT 1A, CMT
  1B, and X-linked CMT (CMT X), it remains important for better characterizing
  the lesions of CMT 2 and forms of genetic peroneal atrophy in which DNA study
  is unrevealing.
