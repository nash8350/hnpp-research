  Clinical and electrophysiological findings and follow-up in tarsal tunnel
  syndrome.
abstract: >-
  The authors report clinical and electrophysiological findings in 59 patients
  with tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS) and follow-up in 23 of them. The entrapment
  was prevalent in females; was bilateral in 6 patients and involved medial
  plantar in 7 and lateral plantar nerves in two cases. Eleven presented with
  other nerve entrapment syndromes or focal mononeuropathies, due to hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy or systemic diseases. The other 48
  subjects had TTS without any other related entrapment syndromes 23 were
  idiopathic cases, 13 had a history of local trauma, 3 had systemic diseases
  and the others had external or intrinsic compressions. The most frequent
  symptoms were paraesthesia or dysaesthesia (86% of feet) and pain (55%).
  Hypoaesthesia of the sole and weakness of toe flexion were evident in 74% and
  22% of feet, respectively. Absence of sensory action potential or slowing of
  sensory conduction velocity (SCV) of the plantar nerves were present in 77% of
  feet; significant differences of SCV between affected and unaffected plantar
  nerves and/or between distal sural and plantar nerves were evident in 14%.
  Abnormalities of plantar SCV were therefore absent in only 9% of feet. Distal
  motor latency was delayed in 55% and electromyography showed neurogenic
  changes in 45% of sole muscles. Five cases (6 feet) underwent surgery with
  excellent or good results in 5, 4 of them also showing improvement in distal
  conduction of the plantar nerves. Nine were treated with local steroid
  injections, with good results shown in 6 patients. Nine other patients who did
  not receive any therapy showed a disappearance of symptoms or good outcome in
  6 cases. The subjects with poor therapeutic results had S1 radiculopathy or
  systemic diseases. The authors underline that patients with connective tissue
  diseases should not be treated by surgical decompression because they may have
  subclinical neuropathy. Some subjects with idiopathic or trauma-induced TTS
  recover spontaneously. Surgical release should be limited to cases with
  space-occupying lesions and when conservative treatments fail.
