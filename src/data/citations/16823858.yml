  Distal compound muscle action potential (DCMAP) dispersion, defined as a DCMAP
  duration > or = 9 ms, and proximal-distal (P-D) CMAP dispersion are considered
  useful in the electrodiagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating
  polyneuropathy (CIDP). Distal and P-D CMAP dispersion have not been fully
  studied in hereditary neuropathies, and it is not known whether these measures
  distinguish hereditary from acquired demyelination. We compared DCMAP duration
  and P-D CMAP dispersion in 91 genetically characterized hereditary
  neuropathies and 33 subjects with CIDP. DCMAP dispersion was more frequent in
  nerves affected by CIDP (41.5%) than in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT)1A
  (24.4%), CMT1B (7.4%), hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP) (10.5%), or CMTX (9.8%). P-D CMAP dispersion was more frequent
  in CIDP (27.7% of nerves) than in hereditary neuropathies (16.3%) when
  applying American Academy of Neurology (AAN) criteria; however, its frequency
  was similar in CIDP and the hereditary neuropathies using the more restrictive
  criteria of the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic
  Medicine (AANEM). Although dispersion is more common in CIDP than in the
  hereditary neuropathies, DCMAP and P-D dispersion occur in at least one motor
  nerve in a significant proportion of hereditary neuropathies, and cannot be
  used in isolation to distinguish acquired from hereditary demyelination.
