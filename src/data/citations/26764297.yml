  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), the most frequent form of inherited
  neuropathy, is a genetically heterogeneous syndrome of the peripheral nervous
  system with a rather homologous clinical phenotype (slowly progressive distal
  weakness and muscle atrophy, skeletal deformities, and areflexia in each
  limb). CMT1 is the autosomal-dominant demyelinating form, and CMT1A (mostly
  PMP22 duplication) is the most frequent subtype, followed by CMTX1, HNPP
  (hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies), CMT1B, or CMT2. As
  CMT is characterized by slowly progressive motor and sensory disturbances in
  each limb, it could be misdiagnosed as chronic inflammatory demyelinating
  polyneuropathy (CIDP) occasionally. Some points can distinguish demyelinating
  CMT from CIDP. CMT1 patients do not show the conduction block that is frequent
  in CIDP. In addition, ultrasonographic findings are useful because CMT1
  suggests diffuse enlargement of peripheral nerves, whereas CIDP is
  characterized by asymmetrical or focal enlargement of peripheral nerves. Some
  CMT1 cases show favorable responses to immunomodulating therapeutics such as
  corticosteroids, IVIg, and plasma exchange. Such CIDP-like CMT1 (especially
  CMT1B or CMT2A) shows moderate to high levels of cerebrospinal fluid protein
  and infiltrated inflammatory macrophages.
