  Great advances have been made in understanding the molecular basis of
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and related neuropathies, namely
  Dejerine-Sottas disease (DSD), hereditary neuropathy with liability to
  pressure palsies (HNPP) and congenital hypomyelination (CH). The number of
  newly uncovered mutations and identified genetic loci is rapidly increasing,
  and, as a consequence, the classification of these disorders is becoming more
  complicated. Molecular genetics, animal models, and transfected cell studies
  are shedding light on function and dysfunction of proteins involved in
  hereditary myelinopathies-peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22), myelin protein
  zero (PO), connexin 32 (Cx32), and early growth response 2 (EGR2). Gene dosage
  effect, loss of function, gain of toxic function, and dominant negative effect
  are possible mechanisms whereby different gene mutations may exert their
  detrimental action on peripheral nerves. A tentative rational approach to
  clinical and molecular diagnosis based on genotype-phenotype correlation
  analysis is described.
