title: Ultrastructural distribution of PMP22 in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A.
abstract: >-
  Peripheral Myelin Protein-22 (PMP22) is a membrane glycoprotein which
  represents up to 5% of total protein in myelin of peripheral nerves. Mutations
  affecting the PMP22 gene have been linked to the inherited peripheral
  neuropathies Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A; duplications and
  point mutations), Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS; point mutations), and
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP; deletions). In
  this study, we determined the ultrastructural distribution of PMP22 and other
  myelin proteins in normal human peripheral nervous system (PNS) nerves and in
  CMT1 patients with or without the CMT1A duplication on chromosome 17. Our
  results demonstrate that PMP22, P0 protein, and myelin basic protein are
  present in compact myelin of all patients examined. PMP22 was also present in
  the plasma membrane of Schwann cells of unmyelinated fibers and onion bulbs.
  Although the precise biological role of PMP22 remains to be discovered, our
  results support the hypothesis that this protein serves multiple functions in
  Schwann cells.
