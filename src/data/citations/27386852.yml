  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) and
  Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) are genomic disorders associated with deletion
  copy number variants involving chromosome 17p12 and 17p11.2, respectively.
  Nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR)-mediated recurrent deletions are
  responsible for the majority of HNPP and SMS cases; the rearrangement products
  encompass the key dosage-sensitive genes PMP22 and RAI1, respectively, and
  result in haploinsufficiency for these genes. Less frequently, nonrecurrent
  genomic rearrangements occur at this locus. Contiguous gene duplications
  encompassing both PMP22 and RAI1, i.e., PMP22-RAI1 duplications, have been
  investigated, and replication-based mechanisms rather than NAHR have been
  proposed for these rearrangements. In the current study, we report molecular
  and clinical characterizations of six subjects with the reciprocal phenomenon
  of deletions spanning both genes, i.e., PMP22-RAI1 deletions. Molecular
  studies utilizing high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization and
  breakpoint junction sequencing identified mutational signatures that were
  suggestive of replication-based mechanisms. Systematic clinical studies
  revealed features consistent with SMS, including features of intellectual
  disability, speech and gross motor delays, behavioral problems and ocular
  abnormalities. Five out of six subjects presented clinical signs and/or
  objective electrophysiologic studies of peripheral neuropathy. Clinical
  profiling may improve the clinical management of this unique group of
  subjects, as the peripheral neuropathy can be more severe or of earlier onset
  as compared to SMS patients having the common recurrent deletion. Moreover,
  the current study, in combination with the previous report of PMP22-RAI1
  duplications, contributes to the understanding of rare complex phenotypes
  involving multiple dosage-sensitive genes from a genetic mechanistic
  standpoint.
