  A case of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies due to
  push-up exercise.
abstract: >-
  A 17-year-old man with no familial history developed motor and sensory
  disturbance of the left upper limb a few days after starting push-up exercise.
  Neurological examination revealed broad weakness and radial sensory
  disturbance of the left upper limb and magnetic resonance neurography showed
  laterality of brachial plexus intensity signals. Therefore, we suspected left
  brachial plexopathy. However, a nerve conduction study showed a broad
  disturbance that could not be explained by only brachial plexopathy. Genetic
  tests revealed a diagnosis of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP). HNPP should be included in the differential diagnosis for
  neuropathy due to slight exercise or nerve compression even when familial
  history is negative.
