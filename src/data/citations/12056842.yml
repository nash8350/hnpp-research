  Minor changes in PMP22 gene dosage have profound effects on the development
  and maintenance of peripheral nerves. This is evident from the genetic disease
  mechanisms in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) as well as transgenic
  animals with altered PMP22 gene dosage. Thus, regulation of PMP22 is a crucial
  aspect in understanding the function of this protein in health and disease. In
  this study, we have generated transgenic mice containing 10 kb of the
  5'-flanking region of the PMP22 gene, including the two previously identified
  alternative promoters, fused to a lacZ reporter gene. We show that this part
  of the PMP22 gene contains the necessary information to mirror the endogenous
  expression pattern in peripheral nerves during development and regeneration
  and in mouse models of demyelination due to genetic lesions. Transgene
  expression is strongly regulated during myelination, demyelination, and
  remyelination in Schwann cells, demonstrating the crucial influence of
  neuron-Schwann cell interactions in the regulation of PMP22. In addition, the
  region of the PMP22 gene present on this transgene confers also neuronal
  expression in sensory and motor neurons. These results provide the crucial
  basis for further dissection of the elements that direct the temporal and
  spatial regulation of the PMP22 gene and to elucidate the molecular basis of
  the master program regulating peripheral nerve myelination.
