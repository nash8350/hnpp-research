  We present the nature of pathogenic SNP array findings in pregnancies without
  ultrasound (US) abnormalities and show the additional diagnostic value of SNP
  array as compared with rapid aneuploidy detection and karyotyping. 1,330
  prenatal samples were investigated with a 0.5-Mb SNP array after the exclusion
  of the most common aneuploidies. In 2.7% (36/1,330) of the cases, pathogenic
  chromosome aberrations were found; a microscopically detectable abnormality in
  0.7% and a submicroscopic aberration in 2%. Our results show that in addition
  to the age- or screening-related aneuploidy risk, in pregnancies without US
  abnormalities, there is a risk of 1148 (9/1,330) for a (sub)microscopic
  abnormality associated with an early-onset often severe disease, 1222
  (6/1,330) for a submicroscopic aberration causing an early-onset disease, 174
  (18/1,330) for carrying a susceptibility locus for a neurodevelopmental
  disorder, and 1443 (3/1,330) for a late-onset disorder (hereditary neuropathy
  with liability to pressure palsies in all three cases). These risk figures are
  important for adequate pretest counseling so that prospective parents can make
  informed individualized choices between targeted prenatal testing and broad
  testing with SNP array. Based on our results, we believe if invasive testing
  is performed, SNP array should be the preferred cytogenetic technique
  irrespective of the indication.
