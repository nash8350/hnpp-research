  Myelinated nerve fibers are highly compartmentalized. Helically wrapped
  lipoprotein membranes of myelin are integrated with subsets of proteins
  specifically in each compartment to shape the physiological behavior of these
  nerve fibers. With the advance of molecular biology and genetics, many
  functions of these proteins have been revealed over the past decade. In this
  review, we will first discuss how action potential propagation has been
  understood by classical electrophysiological studies. In particular, the
  discussion will be concentrated on how the geometric dimensions of myelinated
  nerve fibers (such as internodal length and myelin thickness) may affect nerve
  conduction velocity. This discussion will then extend into how specific myelin
  proteins may shape these geometric parameters, thereby regulating action
  potential propagation. For instance, periaxin may specifically affect the
  internodal length, but not other parameters. In contrast, neuregulin-1 may
  affect myelin thickness, but not axon diameter or internodal length. Finally,
  we will discuss how these basic neurobiological observations can be applied to
  inherited peripheral nerve diseases.
