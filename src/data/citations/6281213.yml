  A case of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is
  described. The main histological findings in sural nerve were focal
  thickenings of myelin-"sausages", "tomaculae"-and wide variability of
  internodal length. Numerous fibers with signs of remyelination were present,
  while there was little evidence of active demyelination. There were moderate
  axonal changes. Electrophysiological study revealed slowed conduction velocity
  in peripheral nerves. The possibility of a congenital myelin defect in this
  disease is discussed.
