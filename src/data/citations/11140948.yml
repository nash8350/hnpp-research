  Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A new method that detects
  both the peripheral myelin protein 22 duplication in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type
  1A disease and the peripheral myelin protein 22 deletion in hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.
abstract: >-
  In Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A disease (CMTIA), heterozygosity for the
  peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) duplication increases the gene dose from
  two to three, whereas, in hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure
  palsies (HNPP), heterozygosity for the PMP22 deletion reduces the gene dose
  from two to one. Thirty-eight Norwegian patients with CMT1, 4 patients with
  HNPP, 15 asymptomatic family members, and 45 normal controls were studied
  using the ABI 7700 sequence detection system and the TaqMan method of
  real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using a comparative
  threshold cycle (Ct) method and albumin as reference gene, the gene copy
  number by PMP22 gene duplication or deletion on chromosome 17p11.2-12 was
  quantified. The PMP22 duplication ratio ranged from 1.50 to 2.21, the PMP22
  deletion ratio ranged from 0.44 to 0.55, and the PMP22 ratio in normals ranged
  from 0.82 to 1.27. All samples were run in triplicate, with a mean standard
  deviation of 0.07 (range 0.01-0.17). Thirty-four of thirty-eight CMT1 patients
  (89.6%) had the PMP22 duplication and the four HNPP patients had the PMP22
  deletion. This was not found in any of the asymptomatic family members or the
  controls. Real-time quantitative PCR is a sensitive, specific, and
  reproducible method for diagnosing PMP22 duplication and deletion. The method
  is fast, allowing 13 patients to be diagnosed in 2 h. It involves no
  radioisotopes and requires no post-PCR handling. In our opinion, real-time
  quantitative PCR is the first method of choice in diagnosing PMP22 duplication
  and deletion.
