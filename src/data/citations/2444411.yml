  Neuropathies with prolonged conduction block, single and grouped
  fasciculations, localized limb myokymia.
abstract: >-
  Fourteen patients presented prolonged conduction block (CB) related to
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (n = 7), neuropathy
  with proximal multifocal persistent CB (n = 2), radiation plexopathy (n = 3)
  and chronic acquired polyneuropathy (n = 2). All subjects presented both
  single and grouped fasciculation potentials that resulted in visible limb
  myokymia in 9 patients. This ectopic activity was recorded only in muscles
  affected by the CB, was more important in severe or complete CB, and often
  arose from terminal branches of blocked axons. These fasciculations and
  grouped fasciculations therefore appear to be causally related to the CB. In
  the presence of localized myokymia, a prolonged CB should be suspected.
