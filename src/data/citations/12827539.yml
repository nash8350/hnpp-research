  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies electrophysiological
  and genetic study of a family with carpal tunnel syndrome as only clinical
  manifestation.
abstract: >-
  Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an
  autosomal dominant disease characterized by recurrent sensory or motor
  manifestations. The molecular basis of HNPP is a deletion on chromosome
  17p11.2. We studied a family (father, 61 years; mother, 55 years; 6 children
  of mean age 25.3 years) showing symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome in 4
  members (the parents and 2 sons). No one of them reported episodes of nerve
  palsy. In all the patients, except the mother and the younger son,
  electrophysiologic evaluation showed a sensorimotor polyneuropathy with
  delayed sensorimotor latencies. Genetic analysis was carried out in the
  parents and the eldest son. The 17p11.2 deletion was detected in the father
  and son, indicating paternal transmission of the disease. Clinical
  manifestations of HNPP may be atypical. Sometimes there is no history of acute
  nerve palsy, as in this family. For this reason, the frequence of HNPP might
  be underestimated. Electrophysiological examination is of great importance for
  the diagnosis of HNPP. Genetic analysis is a rapid and reliable diagnostic
  tool that can be combined with simplified electrophysiological examination,
  avoiding the need for nerve biopsy. In conclusion, the diagnosis of HNPP
  should be invoked in early onset entrapment neuropathies.
