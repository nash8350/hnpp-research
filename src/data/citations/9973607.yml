title: >-
  Splice variants of the nuclear dot-associated Sp100 protein contain homologies
  to HMG-1 and a human nuclear phosphoprotein-box motif.
abstract: >-
  Sp100 and PML are interferon-inducible proteins associated with a new class of
  nuclear domains (known as nuclear dots or PML bodies) which play a role in
  tumorigenesis, virus infections, and autoimmunity. While PML is extensively
  alternatively spliced, only two splice variants are known for Sp100. Here we
  describe the identification and characterization of several Sp100 splice
  variant proteins and support their existence by elucidation of the 3'-end of
  the Sp100 gene. Some of the splice variants contain a domain of significant
  sequence similarity with two previously described highly related
  interferon-inducible nuclear phosphoproteins as well as to suppressin and
  DEAF-1, which altogether define a novel protein motif, termed HNPP-box. One
  class of splice variants contains an almost complete and highly conserved copy
  of the DNA-binding high mobility group 1 protein sequence and thus represent
  novel HMG-box proteins. When expressed transiently, both major classes of
  Sp100 splice variant proteins localize in part to nuclear dots/PML bodies and
  in addition to different nuclear domains. Furthermore, PML was occasionally
  redistributed. These data indicate that alternatively spliced Sp100 proteins
  are expressed, differ in part in localization from Sp100, and might bind to
  chromatin via the HMG domain.
