  To determine whether hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
  (HNPP) and inherited brachial plexus neuropathy (IBPN) are genetically
  distinct disorders and to evaluate the usefulness of fluorescence in situ
  hybridization (FISH) for diagnosing HNPP in individual patients. We studied
  representative metaphases from patients with HNPP and IBPN with use of FISH
  and a DNA probe. With use of FISH, 14 persons from 4 unrelated families with
  HNPP and 7 members from 3 unrelated families with IBPN were studied. We used a
  DNA probe that hybridizes to chromosome 17p11.2 in an area thought to be
  deleted in HNPP. Each participant in this study who had HNPP showed deletion
  of this chromosome site. Each of the 10 control subjects and 7 patients with
  IBPN showed normal fluorescent signals on both number 17 chromosomes. These
  results demonstrate that HNPP and IBPN are genetically different. FISH with
  this probe is a sensitive and specific method for detecting the chromosomal
  deletion in individual patients without the use of family studies or linkage
  analysis.
