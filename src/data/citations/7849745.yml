title: Molecular genetics of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and related neuropathies.
abstract: >-
  Collectively, the inherited disorders of peripheral nerves represent a common
  group of neurologic diseases. Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 1 (CMT1) is
  a genetically heterogeneous group of chronic demyelinating polyneuropathies
  with loci mapping to chromosome 17 (CMT1A), chromosome 1 (CMT1B), the X
  chromosome (CMTX) and to another unknown autosome (CMT1C). CMT1A is most often
  associated with a tandem 1.5 megabase (Mb) duplication in chromosome
  17p11.2-12, or in rare patients may result from a point mutation in the
  peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22) gene. CMT1B is associated with point
  mutations in the myelin protein zero (P0) gene. The molecular defect in CMT1C
  is unknown. X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMTX) is associated with
  mutations in the connexin32 gene. Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type II
  (CMT2) is an axonal neuropathy, also of undetermined cause. One form of CMT2
  maps to chromosome 1p36 (CMT2A). Dejerine-Sottas disease, also called
  hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type III (HMSNIII), is a severe,
  infantile onset demyelinating polyneuropathy syndrome that may be associated
  with point mutations in either the PMP22 gene of the P0 gene. Hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant
  disorder that results in a recurrent, episodic demyelinating neuropathy. HNPP
  is associated with a 1.5 Mb deletion in chromosome 17p11.2-12 and may result
  from reduced expression of the PMP22 gene. CMT1A and HNPP are apparent
  reciprocal duplication/deletion syndromes originating from unequal crossover
  during germ cell meiosis.
