  The aim of this study was to determine the clinical features and frequencies
  of genetic subtypes in a series of patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT)
  disease from Eastern China. Patients were divided into three subtypes, CMT1,
  CMT2 and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP),
  according to their electrophysiological manifestations. Multiplex
  ligation-dependent probe analysis (MLPA) was performed to detect
  duplications/deletions in the PMP22 gene. The coding regions and splice sites
  of the GJB1, MPZ, MFN2 and GDAP-1 genes were determined by direct sequencing.
  Among the 148 patients in the study, 37.2% of the cases had mutations in genes
  assessed. The mutation detection rate was higher in patients with family
  histories than in spontaneous cases. PMP22 duplication (13.5%) was predominant
  in this group of patients, followed by PMP22 deletion (11.5%), and point
  mutations in GJB1 (8.8%), MPZ (2.0%) and MFN2 (0.7%). Three novel mutations
  (c.151T>C and c.310 A>G in GJB1 and c.1516 C>G in MFN2) were detected. A small
  deletion in PMP22 exon 4 was detected in a patient with severe CMT1. Genetic
  tests have great value in CMT patients with family histories. The frequency of
  PMP22 duplications was lower in Asian patients than in others. We suggest that
  genetic testing strategies in CMT patients should be primarily based on
  electromyography data.
