  Peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22) is primarily expressed in the compact
  myelin of the peripheral nervous system. Levels of PMP22 have to be tightly
  regulated since alterations of PMP22 levels by mutations of the PMP22 gene are
  responsible for >50 % of all patients with inherited peripheral neuropathies,
  including Charcot-Marie-Tooth type-1A (CMT1A) with trisomy of PMP22,
  hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) with
  heterozygous deletion of PMP22, and CMT1E with point mutations of PMP22. While
  overexpression and point-mutations of the PMP22 gene may produce
  gain-of-function phenotypes, deletion of PMP22 results in a loss-of-function
  phenotype that reveals the normal physiological functions of the PMP22
  protein. In this article, we will review the basic genetics, biochemistry and
  molecular structure of PMP22, followed by discussion of the current
  understanding of pathogenic mechanisms involving in the inherited neuropathies
  with mutations in PMP22 gene.
