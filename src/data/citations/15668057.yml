  We present a 10-year-old female diagnosed having hereditary neuropathy with
  liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). She had suffered from acute, recurrent
  monoplegic episodes affecting both the sciatic nerves and the left brachial
  plexus since the age of 7 years. The paresis seemed to be triggered by hiking
  and athletic training. Electrophysiological studies showed a conduction block
  in the proximal portions of affected nerves. The FISH method disclosed a
  deletion of the peripheral myelin protein 22 gene. This school child having
  HNPP is considered to be susceptible to the influence of abundant physical
  training, rather than minor trauma or compression at sites of entrapment of
  peripheral nerves.
