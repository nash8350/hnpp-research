  Large genomic duplications and deletions are increasingly recognized as a
  cause of human disease. Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary
  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) result, respectively, from
  a duplication or deletion of a 1.5 Mb genomic region in 17p11.2-12, containing
  the PMP22 gene. In routine diagnostic analysis, CMT1A status is inferred from
  the detection of an imbalanced dosage of two alleles or the presence of three
  alleles of a polymorphic marker flanking the PMP22 gene. HNPP is suspected if
  only one allele is seen, but hemizygosity must be confirmed by analyzing
  allele segregation in the family or by other techniques such as Southern
  blotting or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). PCR-based methodologies
  have also been developed that allow single-step determination of the PMP22
  gene copy number, wherein amplicons are typically labeled and/or separated by
  gel electrophoresis. We describe here a fast and reliable PCR-based method for
  the diagnosis of CMT1A and HNPP in which the PMP22 gene is co-amplified with a
  reference gene, and the amplicons are separated according to their size and
  quantified by DHPLC. Our results suggest that this method for quantifying gene
  dosage could be applied to other genomic rearrangements.
