  To study the clinical and electrophysiologic features of a large series of
  carriers of the 17p11.2 deletion. The 17p11.2 deletion is associated in most
  patients with recurrent acute nerve palsies, which is the typical presentation
  of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP).
  Nevertheless, a few other phenotypes have been reported. On the basis of
  clinical and electrophysiologic data, the authors conducted a retrospective
  study of 99 individuals with the 17p11.2 deletion referred to their
  neurogenetic department between 1993 and 1997. In addition to the typical
  presentation of HNPP, they describe five other phenotypes in 15 patients
  recurrent positional short-term sensory symptoms, progressive mononeuropathy,
  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-like polyneuropathy, chronic sensory
  polyneuropathy, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy-like,
  recurrent subacute polyneuropathy; and 14 asymptomatic patients. In all the
  deletion carriers, regardless of their phenotype and by the second decade, the
  authors found a characteristic, multifocal electrophysiologic neuropathy
  consisting of a diffuse increase in distal motor latencies contrasting with
  normal or moderately reduced motor nerve conduction velocities, a diffuse
  reduction in sensory nerve action potential, and multiple focal slowing of
  nerve conduction at the usual sites of entrapment. The key diagnostic
  criterion is a bilateral slowing of sensory and motor nerve conduction at the
  carpal tunnel with at least one abnormal parameter for motor conduction in one
  peroneal nerve. The authors confirm the clinical phenotypic heterogeneity of
  the 17p11.2 deletion and suggest that electrophysiologic examination is a
  reliable tool for screening suspected HNPP patients in its various clinical
  presentations.
