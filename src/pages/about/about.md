Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP) is a rare genetic disease affecting less than 1 in 5,000 people. To learn more about it, read the [NIH Genetics Home Reference for HNPP](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-neuropathy-with-liability-to-pressure-palsies).

#### Access to Journals
I've included links to free full text when they are available. Otherwise, they can be difficult for patients to access. If you live in a city with a public medical research university, you can often use public access terminals or a "friends of the library" account. If you have no other option, [Sci-hub](https://whereisscihub.now.sh/) offers access to most papers.

Researchers: please support open access journals! Also, please consider sharing a preprint version with a patient support group like [HNPP Help](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hnpphelp/).

#### Contributing
If you see any categories are incorrect, please click "edit" to make adjustments and I will review your changes. They are not exact because I created them using automatic key word matching. You'll need a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) account to log in. The code is open source and hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/nash8350/hnpp-research-gatsby). Feel free to open issues on GitHub. You can support research through groups like the [Hereditary Neuropathy Foundation](https://www.hnf-cure.org/cmt-hnpp/).

#### How it's built
The site is built using the [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) framework and [Netlify CMS](http://netlifycms.org/). I retrieved all the research paper data from the public [PubMed's Entrez API](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501/). I included all papers matching the query `HNPP OR (“Hereditary+neuropathy” AND (“pressure palsies” OR “pressure palsy”))`.

#### About Me
I'm a patient with HNPP who created the site to learn more about the current state of research and improve awareness of HNPP. I'm a software developer and I also have experience in medical research.
