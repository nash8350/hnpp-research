Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP) is a rare genetic disease affecting less than 1 in 5,000 people. To learn more about it, read [NIH Genetics Home Reference for HNPP](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-neuropathy-with-liability-to-pressure-palsies).

#### Access to Journals
It can be difficult for patients to access the full text versions of articles. You can access many, but not all articles, using [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/) or [DeepDyve](http://deepdyve.com/). If you live in a large city with a public medical research university, you can often use public access terminals or a "friends of the library" account. If you have no other option, [Sci-hub](https://whereisscihub.now.sh/) offers access to most papers.

Researchers: please support open access journals! Also, support groups would love to read your preprint version. Please share a copy with a group member.

#### About Me
I'm a patient with HNPP who created the site to learn more about the current state of research and improve awareness of HNPP. I'm a software developer and I also have experience in medical research. As a rare disease, awareness and support for HNPP is often lacking in the medical community. I encourage everyone affected by this disease to support medical research and improve awareness.

#### Contributing
You can suggest edits in [Netlify CMS](/admin/) after creating a Netlify account. All the research paper data is publicaly available from [PubMed's Entrez API](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501/). This site is built using [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org). The code is open source and hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/nash8350/hnpp-research-gatsby). Feel free to open issues on GitHub and I'll get back to you.
