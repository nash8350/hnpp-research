Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP) is a rare genetic disease affecting less than 1 in 5,000 people. To learn more about it, read the [NIH Genetics Home Reference for HNPP](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-neuropathy-with-liability-to-pressure-palsies).

#### Access to Journals
The paper details section includes a link to the free full text when it is available. Otherwise, full text can be difficult for readers to access. If you live in a city with a public medical research university, you can often use public access terminals or a "friends of the library" account. If you have no other option, [Sci-hub](https://whereisscihub.now.sh/) offers access to most papers.

Researchers: please support open access journals! Also, please consider sharing a preprint version with a patient support group like [HNPP Help](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hnpphelp/).

#### Questions/Suggestions
Open [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nash8350/hnpp-research-gatsby/issues) with problems you encounter or suggestions. In particular, the categories are approximate so please open an issue if you think any should change. Also, I'd welcome people who want to contribute.

#### How it's built
The site is built using the [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) framework and [Netlify CMS](http://netlifycms.org/). The code is open source and hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/nash8350/hnpp-research-gatsby). All the research paper data comes from the public [PubMed's Entrez API](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501/). It includes all papers matching the query `HNPP OR (“Hereditary+neuropathy” AND (“pressure palsies” OR “pressure palsy”))`. The citation counts are also limited to this data.

#### About Me
I'm a patient with HNPP who created this site to learn more about the current state of research and improve awareness of HNPP. I'm a software developer and I also have experience in medical research.
